# Platform Engineering Plugin

> Cross-platform development rulebook covering security, architecture, and performance for SPA, PWA, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop (Electron/Tauri) applications. MUST/DO/DON'T framework with real-world incident references and platform-specific guidance.

## Agents

### `platform-reviewer`

Adversarial cross-platform code reviewer that audits code against the platform-engineering rulebook.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Tools** | `Read, Glob, Grep, Bash` |
| **Use for** | Reviewing PRs or code for security, architecture, or performance compliance across SPA, PWA, mobile, and desktop platforms |

**Invocation:**

Use the platform-reviewer agent to audit [path or PR]
```

**What it audits:**
- Server validation and trust boundaries
- Auth token storage (cookies vs localStorage vs secure storage)
