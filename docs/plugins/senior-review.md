# Senior Review Plugin

> Catch bugs before they ship. Eight specialized agents review code quality, security, UI timing, distributed flows, startup cycles, cross-component logic integrity, and formal API contracts in parallel -- plus a semantic interconnect mapper that turns codebases into a shared contract/invariant map consumable by every reviewer. Backed by a comprehensive defect taxonomy knowledge base with 140+ defect patterns and CWE/OWASP mappings.

## Agents

### `security-auditor`

Security auditor with attacker mindset specializing in vulnerability detection, CWE/OWASP mapping, and attack scenario construction.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Use for** | Security audits, vulnerability assessment, OWASP/CWE compliance, threat modeling |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the security-auditor agent to audit [system/codebase]
```

**Expertise:**
- Input trust boundaries (injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection)
- Auth/authz (JWT, CSRF, privilege escalation)
- Secrets and cryptographic misuse
- API and header security
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- References `defect-taxonomy` skill for comprehensive CWE-mapped patterns

---

### `ui-race-auditor`

Framework-agnostic UI race condition analyst detecting timing bugs between async data loading, rendering, and event handlers.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Use for** | UI timing bugs, scroll races, focus races, stale closures, measurement races |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the ui-race-auditor agent to analyze [UI component/codebase]
```

---

### `distributed-flow-auditor`

Adversarial cross-service flow analyst for microservices, agent-based, and multi-module distributed systems. Traces request flows, API/message contracts, saga orchestration, timeout chains, and integration boundaries across multiple services or modules.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Use for** | Cross-service analysis, distributed flow tracing, contract verification, multi-service code review |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the distributed-flow-auditor agent to analyze [multi-service system]
```

**Methodology:**
- 6-phase analysis: service topology discovery, contract extraction, cross-boundary flow tracing, timeout chain validation, resilience pattern audit, message ordering and delivery
- Hunts for contract mismatches, cascading timeout violations, missing idempotency, broken saga compensation, message ordering bugs, and split-brain risks
- Both sides of every boundary verified: producer `file:line` AND consumer `file:line`
- References `defect-taxonomy` skill for CWE-mapped detection strategies

---

### `chicken-egg-detector`

Detects chicken-and-egg problems, circular initialization dependencies, and bootstrap deadlocks across services, modules, and infrastructure. Traces startup ordering, init sequences, config bootstrapping, and migration dependencies.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Use for** | Startup dependency analysis, circular initialization detection, bootstrap cycle auditing, service startup ordering review |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the chicken-egg-detector agent to analyze [system/infrastructure]
```

**Methodology:**
- 6-phase analysis: component inventory and init sequence discovery, dependency graph construction, bootstrap sequence analysis, temporal coupling detection, migration and schema dependency analysis, infrastructure dependency mapping
- Finds cases where component A requires B to be ready but B requires A -- creating deadlocks, flaky startups, or hidden temporal coupling
- Concrete evidence: every finding includes file:line references for both sides of the dependency cycle
- References `defect-taxonomy` skill for integration error patterns

---

### `semantic-interconnect-mapper`

Phase 1b context-builder that produces a structured map of a codebase's contracts, invariants, domain rules, assumptions, integration hot-spots, and call graph. Output is consumed by every downstream reviewer (logic-integrity-auditor, code-auditor, security-auditor, distributed-flow-auditor, api-contract-auditor, chicken-egg-detector, ui-race-auditor) so they can find cross-component bugs instead of only local issues.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Tools** | Read, Grep, Glob |
| **Use for** | Pre-review context building when running `/team-review` or `/map-codebase`; generating the `.team-review/02-interconnect.md` artifact that drives the logic-integrity and contract reviewers |

**Invocation:**
```
Used automatically by /team-review Phase 1b (after deep-dive analysis) and by /map-codebase pipelines; rarely invoked directly
```

**Output sections:** `## Contracts` (formal + implicit), `## Invariants` (temporal + structural), `## Assumptions` (unverified), `## Domain Rules`, `## Integration Hot-Spots` (HTTP, queue, IPC, env/config), `## Call Graph`. Each section is self-contained so reviewers can Grep a single heading and get full context.

---

### `logic-integrity-auditor`

Adversarial reviewer that hunts for violations of contracts, invariants, assumptions, domain rules, ordering, idempotency, and state machines documented in the interconnect map. Catches bugs no local-only reviewer can see -- logic drift across components, implicit contracts silently broken, terminal states mutated, retry paths double-committing.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Use for** | `/team-review` Phase 2 (always-on in the review preset); logic/contract/invariant audit of code with an associated interconnect map |

**Invocation:**
```
Used automatically by /team-review; requires .team-review/02-interconnect.md (produced by semantic-interconnect-mapper)
```

**Methodology:** Reads the interconnect map + target files, proves violations of documented contracts / invariants / domain rules / assumptions. Stops and reports if interconnect map is absent (precondition failure).

---

### `api-contract-auditor`

Adversarial auditor for formal API contracts -- OpenAPI / Swagger, JSON Schema, GraphQL SDL, gRPC `.proto`, AsyncAPI for event schemas, TypeScript DTOs, Pydantic models. Hunts for contract-code drift, breaking changes hidden as minor version bumps, missing nullable markers, type mismatches between producer and consumer schemas, underspecified error responses.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Tools** | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash |
| **Use for** | Auditing OpenAPI/Swagger/GraphQL/gRPC specs for drift vs implementation; reviewing a PR that touches an API boundary; spec-first development audit; checking backwards compatibility before a release |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the api-contract-auditor agent to review [spec file or API boundary]
```

**Methodology:**
- 5-phase audit: contract inventory (find every spec artifact) -> contract-vs-implementation drift -> breaking-change detection (BREAKING / SAFE / AMBIGUOUS classification) -> consumer-side audit (hand-written + generated clients) -> cross-contract coherence
- Every finding cites producer `file:line` AND consumer `file:line`
- Handles OpenAPI 3.1, GraphQL SDL, gRPC, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, Pydantic, TypeScript DTOs, Zod schemas
- Fulfills the `semantic-interconnect-mapper` `## Contracts` (formal) anchor

## Commands

### `/full-review`

Multi-phase comprehensive code review with checkpoints and persistent sessions. 5 phases: Code Audit, Security & Performance, Testing & Documentation, Best Practices, Consolidated Report.

```
/full-review src/features/auth/ --security-focus
```

**Options:**
| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--deep-dive` | Gather structural/semantic context first |
| `--security-focus` | Prioritize security analysis |
| `--performance-critical` | Deep performance review |
| `--strict-mode` | Strictest quality standards |
| `--framework react\|django` | Framework-specific checks |

---

### `/code-review`

Unified code review that auto-detects scope: uncommitted/staged changes, recent commits, PR number, or branch diff. Fires code-auditor, security-auditor, and dead code agents in parallel.

```
/code-review                    # auto-detect: uncommitted changes or branch diff
/code-review 42                 # review PR #42
/code-review --commits 3        # review last 3 commits
/code-review --branch feature   # review branch diff
/code-review --auto-comment     # post findings as PR comments
```

---

### `/cleanup-dead-code`

Find and remove dead code. Auto-detects language: Knip for TypeScript/JavaScript, vulture + ruff for Python. Runs tests before and after to catch regressions.

```
/cleanup-dead-code src/ --dry-run
```

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Report findings without modifying files |
| `--dependencies-only` | Only check unused dependencies |
| `--exports-only` | Only check unused exports |
| `--production` | Skip devDependencies |

**Safety:** Checks `git status` before starting. Reverts changes when tests fail. Asks for approval before removing Python functions/classes (high false-positive rate).

**Related:** Delegates to `typescript-development:knip` (TS/JS) and `python-development:python-dead-code` (Python) skills.

---

### `/pr-review`

Analyze current branch changes, generate a PR description with risk assessment and review checklist, and optionally create the PR via `gh`.

```
/pr-review --create
```

---

**Related:** [agent-teams](agent-teams.md) (`/team-review` and `/team-spawn security` use these agents) | [typescript-development](typescript-development.md) (Knip for dead code) | [python-development](python-development.md) (vulture/ruff for dead code)
