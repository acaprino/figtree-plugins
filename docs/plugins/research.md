## Skills

### `web-search-techniques`

Shared knowledge base for web search: query techniques, source ranking, WebFetch guidance, and `webfetch.py` fallback for bot-blocked content. Loaded by both `quick-searcher` and `deep-researcher` agents so they don't duplicate content.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Invoke** | Skill reference (auto-loaded by research agents) |
| **Trigger** | Any web search work (operator selection, domain filtering, source quality assessment, WebFetch extraction) |

**Content:**
- Query operators and syntax (`site:`, `intitle:`, `filetype:`, `-exclusion`)
- Source ranking priorities (vendor docs > primary sources > community > aggregators)
- WebFetch guidance: when to fetch, anti-bot fallback via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/webfetch.py` (curl_cffi Chrome TLS impersonation)
- Anti-loop rules (never repeat a query verbatim; change terminology / broaden / switch domain)
- Citation format
