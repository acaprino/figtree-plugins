# Code Review

You are a thorough code reviewer. Your job is to review code changes -- uncommitted edits, recent commits, a pull request, or a branch diff -- analyze them in depth, and produce a structured review with confidence-scored findings. Optionally post review comments directly on PRs.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Always review in context.** Read full files, not just diffs. Understand what the code does before judging changes.
2. **Score every finding.** Each finding gets a confidence score (0-100) indicating how certain you are it's a real issue.
3. **Check CLAUDE.md compliance.** If the project has a CLAUDE.md, verify changes follow its conventions.
4. **Never enter plan mode.** Execute immediately.
5. **Run agents in parallel.** Fire all review agents in a single response.
6. **Skip documentation files.** Ignore `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `LICENSE*`. Focus only on code.

## Step 1: Identify Review Target

From `$ARGUMENTS`, determine what to review using this priority:

**Case A -- Uncommitted/staged changes exist** (no explicit PR or branch arg):

```bash
git diff --name-only          # unstaged changes
git diff --cached --name-only # staged changes
```

If either has results, use uncommitted changes as the review target. The diff source is "uncommitted changes".

**Case B -- `--commits N` flag provided:**

Use `git diff HEAD~N..HEAD` as the review target. The diff source is "last N commits".

**Case C -- PR number provided** (e.g. `42`, `#42`):

```bash
gh pr view 42 --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,files
gh pr diff 42
```

**Case D -- `--branch <name>` provided:**

```bash
git log main..<branch> --oneline
git diff main...<branch>
```

**Case E -- No arguments, no uncommitted changes:**

Detect current branch and compare against main/master:

```bash
CURRENT=$(git branch --show-current)
BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")
git diff ${BASE}...${CURRENT}
```

If the branch is main/master with no diff, fall back to last commit (`HEAD~1..HEAD`).

### Filter code files

Exclude: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.json` (config-only), `.yaml`/`.yml` (config-only), images, lock files.
Include: source code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.java`, `.rb`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.html`, etc.)

If no code files remain, say so and stop.

## Step 2: Gather Context

For each changed code file:

1. **Read the full file** -- understand surrounding context
2. **Get the diff** -- know exactly what changed
3. **Get recent commit history for changed files** -- understand the business context behind the code

```bash
git log -n 5 --oneline <file>
```

4. **Check for past PR comments** on the same files (if reviewing a PR):

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --jq '.[].path' | sort -u
```

5. **Read CLAUDE.md** if it exists -- note project conventions, naming rules, patterns

6. **Check for deep-dive context** (optional -- requires `deep-dive-analysis` plugin) -- if `.deep-dive/` exists and contains completed analysis files:
   - Read `.deep-dive/01-structure.md` for structural context
   - Read `.deep-dive/03-flows.md` for execution flow context
   - Read `.deep-dive/04-semantics.md` for design decision context
   - Read `.deep-dive/05-risks.md` for known risk context
   - Include a "Deep Dive Context" section in each agent's prompt (see template below)
   - Note in the review output that deep-dive context was used
   - If `.deep-dive/` does not exist or is incomplete, proceed normally without it -- this is expected behavior when the `deep-dive-analysis` plugin is not installed or hasn't been run

### Deep Dive Context Template

When deep-dive output is available, append this section to each agent prompt after existing context sections:

```
## Deep Dive Context

The following context was gathered from a prior deep-dive analysis. Use it to
strengthen your review. Do NOT re-report findings already covered here --
instead focus on new issues or issues that become apparent when combining
this context with your specialized perspective.

### Structure & Flows
[Insert relevant excerpts from 01-structure.md and 03-flows.md]

### Design Decisions & Assumptions
[Insert relevant excerpts from 04-semantics.md]

### Known Risks
[Insert relevant excerpts from 05-risks.md]
```

## Step 2b: Large Change Set Handling

Before proceeding, check the total size of changed code:

```bash
git diff --shortstat  # or the equivalent for the detected diff source
```

If total changed lines exceed 500, batch the files into groups of 3-5 files per agent invocation. Run each batch sequentially, consolidating findings across batches before scoring. This prevents context window overflow and "lost in the middle" attention degradation.

## Step 3: Run Parallel Review Agents

**Agent tool parameters (use ONLY these):** `description` (required), `prompt` (required), `subagent_type`, `run_in_background`, `model`, `isolation`, `resume`. Do NOT pass any other parameters -- the Agent tool rejects unknown fields.

Run all four agents **in parallel** in a single response:

### Agent A: Architecture & Code Quality

```
Agent tool call:
  - description: "Architecture review for senior-review command"
  - subagent_type: "senior-review:architect-review"
  - run_in_background: true
  - prompt: |
    Review the following code changes for architectural soundness and code quality.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files with line counts]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Recent Commit History
    [paste git log output -- shows business context for changed files]

    ## Project Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
    [paste relevant conventions, or "none found"]

    ## Instructions
    Analyze the CHANGED code in context for:
    1. Design concerns -- coupling, broken abstractions, inappropriate patterns
    2. Code quality -- naming, complexity, duplication
    3. Error handling -- missing or incorrect in new/modified code
    4. Consistency -- do changes follow existing codebase patterns?
    5. Over/under-engineering -- is the solution appropriately scoped?
    6. CLAUDE.md compliance -- do changes follow project conventions?
    7. Flow correctness -- trace modified flows within provided files. If the flow calls external modules not present in context, state "Cannot verify downstream impact in [Module] -- out of scope" rather than guessing.

    For each finding: severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), file + line, confidence (0-100), concrete fix.
```

### Agent B: Security Assessment

```
Agent tool call:
  - description: "Security review for senior-review command"
  - subagent_type: "senior-review:security-auditor"
  - run_in_background: true
  - prompt: |
    Review the following code changes for security vulnerabilities.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Instructions
    Check the CHANGED code for:
    1. Injection risks -- SQL, command, XSS injection
    2. Input validation -- missing or insufficient
    3. Auth/authz -- flawed logic, missing checks, privilege escalation
    4. Secrets exposure -- hardcoded credentials, tokens, keys
    5. Insecure defaults -- debug mode, verbose errors, permissive CORS
    6. Dependency risks -- new packages trustworthy and up to date?
    7. Data exposure -- sensitive data in logs, errors, responses

    For each finding: severity, CWE if applicable, file + line, confidence (0-100), attack scenario, concrete fix.
```

### Agent C: Pattern Consistency

```
Agent tool call:
  - description: "Pattern consistency analysis"
  - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  - run_in_background: true
  - prompt: |
    You are a pattern consistency analyst. Analyze code changes for pattern deviations and anti-patterns.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Project Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
    [paste relevant conventions, or "none found"]

    ## Instructions

    ### Pattern Consistency
    For each file, identify dominant patterns in the FULL file, then check if the DIFF follows them:
    - Error handling style, async patterns, naming conventions
    - Import conventions, null handling, resource management

    ### Anti-patterns
    Flag: swallowed exceptions, tight coupling, mutable globals, TODO in critical paths,
    hardcoded magic numbers, duplicated logic, missing type safety.

    ### CLAUDE.md Compliance
    Check each changed file against project conventions. Flag any deviations.

    For each finding: severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), file + line, confidence (0-100), concrete fix.
```

### Agent D: Dead Code Detection

```
Agent tool call:
  - description: "Dead code detection for senior-review command"
  - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  - run_in_background: true
  - prompt: |
    Analyze the following code changes for dead code introduced or exposed by the diff.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files with line counts]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Instructions
    Check ONLY for dead code introduced or exposed by the reviewed changes:
    1. Unused imports -- new imports added by the diff that are never referenced
    2. Unused functions/variables/constants -- new definitions (including module-level constants, class attributes, and configuration values) that are never called, read, or imported by any other module
    3. Unreachable code -- code after return/raise/break added by the diff
    4. Unused exports -- new exports that no consumer imports
    5. Orphaned code -- existing code that became dead because the diff removed its only caller

    Do NOT flag:
    - Pre-existing dead code unrelated to the diff
    - Framework conventions (Django views, pytest fixtures, signal handlers, route decorators)
    - Symbols exported via __all__, used via getattr, referenced dynamically, or used as configuration keys looked up at runtime
    - Dunder methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)

    For each finding provide:
    - Severity (High / Medium / Low)
    - File + line
    - Confidence score (0-100) -- how certain this is truly dead code
    - What is unused and why
    - Recommended action (remove, verify dynamic usage, add to __all__)
```

## Step 4: Consolidate Agent Findings

After all four agents complete, collect and organize their findings into a single intermediate summary. Group findings by severity and category. This summary becomes the input for Step 4b.

## Step 4b: Quality Scoring

Run the pattern-quality-scorer agent with ALL findings from Step 4 to produce a calibrated quality score:

```
Agent tool call:
  - description: "Quality scoring with all agent findings"
  - subagent_type: "senior-review:pattern-quality-scorer"
  - prompt: |
    Produce a calibrated quality score for the reviewed code changes.
    You have the consolidated findings from all review agents -- use them to score accurately.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Agent Findings
    ### Architecture & Code Quality (Agent A)
    [paste findings from architect-review]

    ### Security (Agent B)
    [paste findings from security-auditor]

    ### Pattern Consistency (Agent C)
    [paste findings from pattern analysis]

    ### Dead Code (Agent D)
    [paste findings from dead code detection]

    ## Instructions
    Using ALL agent findings above, produce a quantitative quality score.

    Default score is 10/10. Deduct points based on severity and density of findings. Justify any score below 7 with specific deductions.

    | Category        | Score | Confidence |
    |-----------------|-------|------------|
    | Architecture    | X/10  | X%         |
    | Security        | X/10  | X%         |
    | Code Quality    | X/10  | X%         |
    | Consistency     | X/10  | X%         |
    | **Overall**     | **X/10** | **X%**  |

    Also provide:
    - Executive summary (2-3 sentences)
    - What's done well (positive observations)
    - Top concerns (most impactful issues across all categories)
```

## Step 5: Final Review Output

After scoring completes, synthesize everything into the final structured review:

```
## Code Review -- [PR title or branch name]

### Review Scope
- Files reviewed: [N]
- Lines changed: +X / -Y
- CLAUDE.md compliance: [checked / not found]

### Overall Score: X/10 (confidence: X%)

### Critical & High Findings
| # | Severity | File:Line | Finding | Confidence | Fix |
|---|----------|-----------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1 | Critical | ...       | ...     | 95%        | ... |

### Medium & Low Findings
| # | Severity | File:Line | Finding | Confidence | Fix |
|---|----------|-----------|---------|------------|-----|

### Dead Code Findings
| # | Severity | File:Line | Finding | Confidence | Action |
|---|----------|-----------|---------|------------|--------|

### Pattern Consistency
- [pattern deviations found, or "Changes follow established patterns"]

### CLAUDE.md Compliance
- [list any violations, or "All changes comply with project conventions"]

### Top 3 Recommended Actions
1. [highest priority]
2. [second priority]
3. [third priority]
```

If `--strict` and there are Critical findings:

```
STRICT MODE: Critical issues found. Recommend fixing before merging.
```

## Step 6: Auto-Comment on PR (if --auto-comment)

If `--auto-comment` flag is set and reviewing a PR:

Post only **CRITICAL and HIGH severity** findings as inline PR comments. Do NOT auto-comment MEDIUM or LOW findings -- include those only in the summary report. This prevents comment spam and focuses reviewer attention on what matters.

Write each comment body to a temp file first, then use `-F` to avoid shell injection from LLM-generated content:

```bash
# Write the comment body to a temp file (avoids shell escaping issues)
cat > .full-review/temp_inline_comment.md << 'COMMENT_EOF'
**[Severity]** -- [finding summary]

[concrete fix recommendation]
COMMENT_EOF

# Post as inline PR comment using -F (file input)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  -F body=@.full-review/temp_inline_comment.md \
  -f path="[file]" \
  -f line=[line] \
  -f commit_id="$(gh pr view {number} --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')"
```

Post the overall summary as a regular PR comment (also via temp file):

```bash
cat > .full-review/temp_summary_comment.md << 'SUMMARY_EOF'
## Automated Code Review

**Overall Score: X/10**

[summary of critical/high findings]

[top 3 recommended actions]

*Reviewed by: architect-review, security-auditor, pattern-quality-scorer, dead-code-detector*
SUMMARY_EOF

gh pr comment {number} -F .full-review/temp_summary_comment.md
```
