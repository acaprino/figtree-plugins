# Reply to Customer Review

Generate a professional, empathetic response to a customer review. Analyze the review, craft an adaptive response, and provide operational suggestions.

## Input

The user pastes a customer review (or invokes via `/reply-to-customer-review`). Optional parameters:

- **--brand "Name"** -- business name to use in the response
- **--tone formal|friendly|casual** -- override tone (default: professional-empathetic)
- **--lang XX** -- force output language (default: same as review)
- **--sector hospitality|ecommerce|auto** -- force sector (default: auto-detect)

If invoked without arguments, prompt the user to paste a review.

## Process

Execute all three steps inline. Do NOT spawn subagents.

### Step 1: Analysis

Analyze the review and determine:

**Language** -- identify the review language. For mixed-language reviews, identify the dominant language and note secondary languages.

**Sentiment** -- classify as one of:
- POSITIVE -- satisfied customer, praise, recommendation
- NEUTRAL -- factual, neither praise nor complaint
- NEGATIVE -- dissatisfaction, complaint, criticism
- MIXED -- contains both positive and negative elements

**Key Points** -- extract the specific topics mentioned (e.g., cleanliness, shipping speed, product quality, staff attitude, app stability, price, location).

**Severity** (negative/mixed reviews only) -- assess as one of:
- UNFOUNDED -- no real issue, emotional venting, unrealistic expectations
- MINOR -- real issue but limited impact, easy to address
- MAJOR -- serious issue requiring immediate attention, systemic problem
- ABUSIVE -- contains threats, profanity, personal attacks. Flag for platform reporting. Recommend not responding publicly or generate a minimal professional response. Never mirror hostility.

**Sector** -- auto-detect from vocabulary and context:
- HOSPITALITY -- mentions stay, check-in, room, host, property, booking, location, amenities, noise, breakfast
- ECOMMERCE -- mentions shipping, delivery, return, refund, product, app, crash, bug, update, order, package
- GENERIC -- does not clearly match either sector

Load the appropriate reference file: `references/hospitality-patterns.md` or `references/ecommerce-patterns.md`. If generic, use general best practices.

### Edge Cases

- **Star-only (no text):** Ask the user for the star rating. Generate a brief acknowledgment appropriate to the implied sentiment.
- **Very short (under 5 words):** Flag ambiguity in Analysis. Generate a brief response inviting the customer to share more details.
- **Mixed-language:** Respond in the dominant language. Note secondary language in Analysis.

### Step 2: Response Generation

Craft the response following these rules:

**Tone:** Use the user-specified tone or default to professional-empathetic. The tone scale:
- `formal` -- corporate, third-person, measured language
- `friendly` -- warm, first-person, conversational but professional (this is the professional-empathetic default)
- `casual` -- relaxed, direct, uses contractions and informal phrasing

**Language:** Respond in the same language as the review unless --lang overrides.

**Brand:** If --brand is provided, sign off with the brand name. If not, use a generic professional sign-off.

**Adaptive strategy for negative reviews:**

| Severity | Strategy | Key Elements |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| UNFOUNDED | Diplomatic-defensive | Acknowledge feelings, provide factual context, invite private contact |
| MINOR | Empathetic-proactive | Thank for feedback, acknowledge the issue, describe corrective action taken, invite return |
| MAJOR | Empathetic-proactive (urgent) | Sincere apology, take full responsibility, describe immediate corrective action, offer compensation, provide direct contact for follow-up |
| ABUSIVE | Minimal/No response | If responding: brief, professional, offer private channel. May recommend not responding and reporting to platform instead |

**For positive reviews:** Thank sincerely, reference specific points mentioned, reinforce the positive experience, invite return/continued use. Keep it genuine -- avoid sounding templated.

**For neutral reviews:** Thank for taking the time, address any suggestions, invite further engagement.

**Response length guidelines:**
- Positive reviews: 2-4 sentences
- Neutral reviews: 2-3 sentences
- Negative (minor): 3-5 sentences
- Negative (major): 4-6 sentences
- Abusive: 1-2 sentences max (if responding at all)

### Step 3: AI Trace Removal

Before presenting the response, run it through the `text-humanizer` agent to remove AI writing traces. The response must sound like a real person wrote it -- not a chatbot template.

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "text-humanizer"
  description: "Remove AI writing traces from review response"
  prompt: |
    Humanize this review response. Remove AI patterns (filler phrases, promotional
    language, sycophantic tone, rule of three, generic positive conclusions) while
    preserving the empathetic tone and factual content. Keep it short and natural.

    Do NOT add the self-evaluation pass -- just return the cleaned text.

    Text:
    [generated response]
```

### Step 4: Output

Present three clearly separated sections:

**RESPONSE**

The ready-to-copy response text (after AI trace removal), formatted for the review platform. No markdown formatting -- plain text that can be pasted directly.

**ANALYSIS**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Language | [detected language] |
| Sentiment | [POSITIVE/NEUTRAL/NEGATIVE/MIXED] |
| Severity | [UNFOUNDED/MINOR/MAJOR/ABUSIVE or N/A] |
| Sector | [HOSPITALITY/ECOMMERCE/GENERIC] |
| Key Points | [comma-separated list] |
| Flags | [any concerns requiring attention, or "None"] |

**OPERATIONAL SUGGESTIONS**

Bulleted list of recommended internal actions based on the review content. Examples:
- Flag issue to [specific team]
- Update [specific asset] to reflect current state
- Contact customer privately via [channel]
- Offer [specific compensation]
- Monitor for recurring pattern of [issue]
- No action needed -- positive reinforcement

If the review is positive with no issues, suggest ways to leverage it (e.g., "Consider featuring this review on your website", "Share with the team as positive feedback").

## Refinement

After presenting the output, the user may request adjustments:
- "more formal" / "more casual" -- regenerate with adjusted tone
- "shorter" / "longer" -- adjust response length
- "in English" / "in italiano" -- regenerate in specified language
- "don't mention X" / "add Y" -- specific content adjustments

Regenerate only the RESPONSE section when adjusting. Keep Analysis and Operational Suggestions unchanged unless the user specifically asks to revise them.
