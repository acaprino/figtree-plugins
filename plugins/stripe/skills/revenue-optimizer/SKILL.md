# Revenue Optimizer

Build revenue features and monetization systems. Analyze existing codebases to understand features, calculate costs, and create data-driven pricing strategies.

## Workflow

1. **Discover** - Scan codebase for features, services, and integrations
2. **Cost Analysis** - Calculate per-user and per-feature costs from services
3. **Design** - Create pricing tiers based on value + cost data
4. **Implement** - Build payment integration, pricing logic, and checkout flows
5. **Optimize** - Add conversion optimization and revenue tracking

## Feature Discovery

Scan codebase to build feature inventory:

```
Feature Discovery Process:
1. Scan routes/endpoints → identify user-facing features
2. Scan components/pages → map UI features
3. Scan service integrations → identify cost-generating features
4. Scan database models → understand data entities
5. Cross-reference → map features to their cost drivers
```

Look for these patterns:
- **Routes/Controllers**: Each endpoint = potential feature
- **React/Vue components**: Feature-specific UI modules
- **Service clients**: AWS SDK, OpenAI, Stripe, Twilio, etc.
- **Background jobs**: Compute-intensive operations
- **Storage operations**: S3, database writes, file uploads

Example feature inventory output:
```
Features Discovered:
├── Core (low cost): Auth, dashboard, CRUD
├── Premium (medium cost): PDF export, email, file storage
└── High-Value (high cost): AI analysis, video processing, real-time sync
```

## Cost Analysis

Analyze services to calculate true costs per user/feature. See [references/cost-analysis.md](references/cost-analysis.md) for detailed patterns.

### Service Detection

Scan for these cost sources:
- **Config files**: `.env`, `config/`, secrets
- **Package.json/requirements.txt**: SDK dependencies
- **Infrastructure**: `terraform/`, `cloudformation/`, `docker-compose`
- **Code imports**: `aws-sdk`, `openai`, `stripe`, `twilio`, etc.

### Cost Mapping

Map fixed costs, variable costs (per user), and feature costs (per use). See [references/cost-analysis.md](references/cost-analysis.md) for detailed cost mapping patterns and output format.

## Pricing Strategy Design

Combine feature value + cost data:

1. Calculate cost floor (break-even per user)
2. Assess feature value (what users pay for alternatives)
3. Set price = max(cost + margin, perceived value)
4. Group features into tiers by cost similarity:
   - **Free**: Low-cost features only, cap variable costs, goal < $0.50/user/month
   - **Pro**: Medium-cost features, price at 3-5x cost, primary revenue driver
   - **Enterprise**: High-cost features (AI, video), value-based pricing (10x+ cost OK)

Optimal Price = (Cost Floor x 0.3) + (Value Ceiling x 0.7) where Cost Floor = Cost to Serve / (1 - Target Margin).

See [references/pricing-patterns.md](references/pricing-patterns.md) for implementation examples.

PRICING STRATEGY REPORT
=======================================

CODEBASE ANALYSIS
---------------------------------------
Services: AWS S3, OpenAI GPT-4, SendGrid, Auth0, Vercel, PlanetScale

Features:
  Core (6): Dashboard, project mgmt, collaboration, reporting
  Premium (3): PDF export (Lambda), analytics (Postgres), API access
  AI-Powered (2): AI writing + smart suggestions (GPT-4)

COST BREAKDOWN
---------------------------------------
Fixed (Monthly):
  Vercel $20 + PlanetScale $29 + Auth0 $0 = $49/month

Variable (Per User/Month):
  Auth0 $0.02 + Storage $0.01 + Email $0.01 = $0.04/user

Feature (Per Use):
  AI Writing $0.03 | PDF Export $0.01 | API $0.001

USAGE PATTERNS
---------------------------------------
  API Calls/month:   Casual 50% ~50 | Regular 40% ~500 | Power 10% ~5K
  AI Generations:    Casual ~5 | Regular ~50 | Power ~300

Tier Limits: Free 100 API/10 AI | Pro 5K API/100 AI | Business unlimited

REVENUE MODEL
---------------------------------------
Distribution: Free 80% | Pro 15% | Business 5%
ARPU: (80% x $0) + (15% x $19) + (5% x $49) = $5.30/user
LTV: ($5.30 x 0.87) / 0.04 = $115
Cost to Serve: Free $0.10 | Pro $2.50 | Business $12
Break-Even: 62 users

12-Month Projection (15% growth):
  M1: 100 users, $530 MRR
  M6: 266 users, $1,410 MRR
  M12: 814 users, $4,314 MRR -- $51,768 ARR

## Payment Provider Selection

| Provider | Best For | Integration Complexity |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Stripe | SaaS, subscriptions, global | Low |
| Paddle | SaaS with tax compliance | Low |
| LemonSqueezy | Digital products, simple | Very Low |
| PayPal | Marketplaces, existing users | Medium |

For detailed integration patterns, see:
- **Stripe**: [references/stripe.md](references/stripe.md)

## Pricing Tier Design

Common patterns:
- **Good-Better-Best**: 3 tiers with clear value escalation
- **Freemium**: Free tier with premium upsell
- **Usage-Based**: Pay per API call, storage, or compute
- **Per-Seat**: Charge per team member

For tier structure examples and implementation, see [references/pricing-patterns.md](references/pricing-patterns.md).

## Subscription Implementation

Key components:
1. **Subscription state management** - Track active, canceled, past_due
2. **Webhook handling** - Process payment events reliably
3. **Entitlement system** - Gate features based on plan
4. **Billing portal** - Self-service plan management

For subscription system patterns, see [references/subscription-patterns.md](references/subscription-patterns.md).

## Checkout Optimization

Conversion-focused checkout implementation:
- Minimize form fields (email → payment in 2 steps max)
- Show trust signals (security badges, money-back guarantee)
- Display social proof near purchase button
- Offer annual discount prominently (20-40% standard)
- Pre-select recommended plan

For checkout implementation details, see [references/checkout-optimization.md](references/checkout-optimization.md).

## Feature Gating Pattern

```typescript
// Entitlement check pattern
async function checkFeatureAccess(userId: string, feature: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const subscription = await getSubscription(userId);
  const plan = PLANS[subscription.planId];
  return plan.features.includes(feature);
}

// Usage in route/component
if (!await checkFeatureAccess(user.id, 'advanced_export')) {
  return showUpgradePrompt('advanced_export');
}
```

## Revenue Tracking

Essential metrics to implement:
- **MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- **Churn Rate** (cancellations / total subscribers)
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value = ARPU / churn rate)
- **Conversion Rate** (paid / total signups)

Implementation: Send events to analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude, or custom) on:
- `subscription.created`
- `subscription.upgraded`
- `subscription.canceled`
- `payment.succeeded`
- `payment.failed`

## Quick Implementation Checklist
