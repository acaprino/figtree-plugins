# Mobile Tauri Pipeline

## CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES

You MUST follow these rules exactly. Violating any of them is a failure.

1. **Execute phases in order.** Do NOT skip ahead, reorder, or merge phases.
2. **Write output files.** Each phase MUST produce its output file in `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/` before the next phase begins. Read from prior phase files -- do NOT rely on context window memory.
3. **Stop at checkpoints.** When you reach a `PHASE CHECKPOINT`, you MUST stop and wait for explicit user approval before continuing. Use the AskUserQuestion tool with clear options.
4. **Halt on failure.** If any step fails (agent error, ADB connection, missing files), STOP immediately. Present the error and ask the user how to proceed. Do NOT silently continue.
5. **Never enter plan mode autonomously.** Do NOT use EnterPlanMode. This command IS the plan -- execute it.
6. **Brainstorming is interactive.** Phase 2 MUST involve back-and-forth with the user -- ask questions one at a time, propose approaches, get approval.

## Pre-flight Checks

### 0. Dependency check

This command requires agents and skills from other plugins. Before proceeding, verify they are installed:

**Required plugins:**
- `app-analyzer` -- app-analyzer agent (Phase 1)
- `ai-tooling` -- brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans skills (Phases 2, 5, 6)
- `frontend` -- web-designer agent (Phase 3)

**Optional plugins:**
- `tauri-development` -- tauri-mobile skill, rust-engineer, tauri-desktop agents (Phases 4, 7, 8)
- `senior-review` -- architect-review, security-auditor, pattern-quality-scorer agents (Phase 9)
- `humanize` -- humanize agent (Phase 10)

Check by looking for the agent/skill files. If a required plugin is missing, STOP and tell the user:

```
Missing required plugin(s): [list]

This workflow command depends on agents and skills from other anvil-toolset plugins.
Install them with:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset --plugin <name>

Or install the full marketplace:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset
```

If only optional plugins are missing, warn but continue (skip their phases).

### 1. Verify ADB connection

```bash
adb devices
```

- If no devices listed: STOP and tell the user to connect a device or start an emulator.
- If `--device <device-id>` flag is provided, verify that specific device is connected.
- If multiple devices and no `--device` flag, ask the user which device to use.

### 2. Check for existing session

Check if `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/state.json` exists:

- If it exists and `status` is `"in_progress"`: Read it, display the current phase, and ask:
  ```
  Found an in-progress mobile Tauri pipeline session:
  Target: [target from state]
  Current phase: [phase from state]

  1. Resume from where we left off
  2. Start fresh (archives existing session)
  ```
- If it exists and `status` is `"complete"`: Ask whether to archive and start fresh.

### 3. Initialize state

Create `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/` directory and `state.json`:

```json
{
  "target": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "flags": {
    "device": null,
    "skip_scaffold": false,
    "skip_review": false,
    "strict_mode": false
  },
  "current_phase": 1,
  "completed_phases": [],
  "files_created": [],
  "started_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "last_updated": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
}
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--device`, `--skip-scaffold`, `--skip-review`, and `--strict-mode` flags.

---

## PART A: MOBILE INTELLIGENCE (Phases 1-3)

---

## Phase 1: Competitor App Analysis

Use the app-analyzer agent to analyze the target app via ADB.

### Process

1. **Launch the target app** on the connected device:
   ```bash
   adb shell monkey -p <package-name> -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
   ```

2. **Navigate key screens** -- for each screen:
   - Capture screenshot: `adb exec-out screencap -p > .mobile-tauri-pipeline/screenshots/screen-NN.png`
   - Record the screen name, purpose, and UI elements observed
   - Note navigation patterns, gestures, transitions

3. **Document the following:**
   - App architecture (tab-based, drawer, stack navigation)
   - Key user flows (onboarding, core action, settings)
   - UX patterns (loading states, error handling, empty states)
   - Design language (colors, typography, spacing, icons)
   - Unique features and differentiators
   - Pain points and UX friction

**Output file:** `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/01-competitor-analysis.md`

---

## Phase 2: Brainstorm Differentiating Features

Read `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/01-competitor-analysis.md` for context.

Follow the brainstorming skill process -- this phase is **interactive**:

### Step 2A: Explore context

Review the competitor analysis. Identify biggest opportunities from the competitor's weaknesses.

### Step 2B: Ask clarifying questions (one at a time)

- What is the target audience?
- Which competitor weaknesses matter most?
- Features to include or exclude?
- Primary differentiator?
- Target platform priority (Android-first, iOS-first, both)?

Use AskUserQuestion with multiple-choice options. One question per message.

### Step 2C: Propose approaches

Propose 2-3 differentiation strategies:
- Feature parity + UX improvements
- Niche focus with fewer but better features
- Platform-native features the competitor doesn't leverage

### Step 2D: Present design

Present features organized by priority: Must-have (v1), Nice-to-have (v1.1), Future (v2). Get user approval.

**Output file:** `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/02-brainstorm.md`

Update `state.json`: set `current_phase` to 3, add phase 2 to `completed_phases`.

Follow the executing-plans skill process with batch execution:

### Execution Loop

Execute tasks in batches of 3:

1. **For each task in the batch:**
   - Mark as in_progress
   - Follow each step exactly (test first, then implement)
   - Run all verification commands
   - If a test fails: STOP the batch, report the failure, ask the user
   - Mark as completed

2. **After each batch:**
   - Show what was implemented
   - Show verification output (test results)
   - Ask: "Ready for feedback on this batch?"

3. **Wait for user feedback** before starting next batch.

4. **Repeat** until all tasks are complete.

Log to `.mobile-tauri-pipeline/06-execution-log.md`:

```markdown
# Phase 6: Execution Log

## Task 1: [name]
