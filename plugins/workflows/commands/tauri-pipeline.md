# Tauri Desktop Pipeline

## CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES

You MUST follow these rules exactly. Violating any of them is a failure.

1. **Execute phases in order.** Do NOT skip ahead, reorder, or merge phases.
2. **Write output files.** Each phase MUST produce its output file in `.tauri-pipeline/` before the next phase begins. Read from prior phase files -- do NOT rely on context window memory.
3. **Stop at checkpoints.** When you reach a `PHASE CHECKPOINT`, you MUST stop and wait for explicit user approval before continuing. Use the AskUserQuestion tool with clear options.
4. **Halt on failure.** If any step fails (agent error, missing files, access issues), STOP immediately. Present the error and ask the user how to proceed. Do NOT silently continue.
5. **Never enter plan mode autonomously.** Do NOT use EnterPlanMode. This command IS the plan -- execute it.
6. **Respect scope flags.** If `--rust-only` is set, run only Phases 1-2 then skip to completion. If `--frontend-only` is set, skip Phases 1-2 and start at Phase 3.

## Pre-flight Checks

### 0. Dependency check

This command requires agents from other plugins. Before proceeding, verify they are installed:

**Required plugins:**
- `tauri-development` -- rust-engineer, tauri-desktop agents (Phases 1-2)
- `frontend` -- ui-layout-designer, web-designer agents (Phases 4-5)
- `react-development` -- react-performance-optimizer agent (Phase 3)

Check by looking for the agent/skill files. If a required plugin is missing:

- If `tauri-development` is missing and `--frontend-only` is NOT set, STOP and tell the user.
- If `frontend` is missing and `--rust-only` is NOT set, STOP and tell the user.
- If the missing plugin's phases would be skipped by flags, warn but continue.

```
Missing required plugin(s): [list]

This workflow command depends on agents from other anvil-toolset plugins.
Install them with:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset --plugin <name>

Or install the full marketplace:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset
```

### 1. Verify Tauri project structure

Check that `src-tauri/` directory and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (or `tauri.conf.json` at root) exist:

```bash
ls src-tauri/tauri.conf.json 2>/dev/null || ls tauri.conf.json 2>/dev/null
```

If neither exists, STOP and tell the user this command requires a Tauri 2 project.

### 2. Check for existing session

Check if `.tauri-pipeline/state.json` exists:

- If it exists and `status` is `"in_progress"`: Read it, display the current phase, and ask:
  ```
  Found an in-progress pipeline session:
  Target: [target from state]
  Current phase: [phase from state]

  1. Resume from where we left off
  2. Start fresh (archives existing session)
  ```
- If it exists and `status` is `"complete"`: Ask whether to archive and start fresh.

### 3. Initialize state

Create `.tauri-pipeline/` directory and `state.json`:

```json
{
  "target": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "flags": {
    "rust_only": false,
    "frontend_only": false,
    "strict_mode": false
  },
  "current_phase": 1,
  "completed_phases": [],
  "files_created": [],
  "started_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "last_updated": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
}
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--rust-only`, `--frontend-only`, and `--strict-mode` flags.

### 4. Identify target scope

Determine what to review from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- If a path is given, verify it exists
- If no path, default to the entire project
- Scan for Rust files (`src-tauri/src/`), frontend files (`src/`), and config files

**Output file:** `.tauri-pipeline/00-scope.md`

```markdown

## Phase 1: Rust Backend Review

**Skip if:** `--frontend-only` flag is set.

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "rust-engineer"
  description: "Rust backend review for Tauri app"
  prompt: |
    Review the Rust backend of this Tauri 2 desktop application.

    ## Scope
    [Insert contents of .tauri-pipeline/00-scope.md — Rust Backend Files section]

    ## Instructions
    Analyze the Rust code for:
    1. **Ownership & borrowing**: Unnecessary clones, lifetime issues, borrow checker workarounds
    2. **Error handling**: Proper use of Result/Option, error propagation, custom error types
    3. **Command handlers**: Tauri command signatures, async commands, state management
    4. **Memory safety**: Unsafe blocks, FFI boundaries, resource cleanup
    5. **Performance**: Hot paths, allocation patterns, unnecessary copies
    6. **Idiomatic Rust**: Modern patterns, clippy warnings, API design
    7. **Concurrency**: Tokio usage, channel patterns, mutex contention

    For each finding: severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), file + line, concrete fix.
    Note what's done well.

    Write your findings as a structured markdown document.
```

Write output to `.tauri-pipeline/01-rust-review.md`:

```markdown
# Phase 1: Rust Backend Review

## Findings
[Organized by severity]

## What's Done Well
[Positive observations]

## Key Issues for Phase 2 Context
[Findings that affect Tauri IPC layer]
```

Update `state.json`: set `current_phase` to 2, add phase 1 to `completed_phases`.

---

## Phase 2: Tauri IPC & Optimization

**Skip if:** `--frontend-only` flag is set.

Read `.tauri-pipeline/01-rust-review.md` for context.

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "tauri-desktop"
  description: "Tauri IPC architecture and optimization review"
  prompt: |
    Review the Tauri 2 IPC architecture, plugin usage, and optimization opportunities.

    ## Scope
    [Insert contents of .tauri-pipeline/00-scope.md]

    ## Phase 1 Context
    [Insert contents of .tauri-pipeline/01-rust-review.md — Key Issues section]

    ## Instructions
    Analyze for:
    1. **IPC architecture**: Command design, payload serialization, batch operations
    2. **State management**: Tauri state containers, shared state between commands
    3. **Plugin usage**: Are plugins configured correctly? Missing capabilities?
    4. **Security**: CSP configuration, allowed origins, command permissions
    5. **Window management**: Multi-window IPC, WebView configuration
    6. **Build optimization**: Bundle size, feature flags, Cargo profile settings
    7. **Event system**: Custom events, event listeners, cleanup patterns

    For each finding: severity, file, issue, concrete fix recommendation.
    Note what's done well.

    Write your findings as a structured markdown document.
```

Write output to `.tauri-pipeline/02-tauri-optimization.md`:

```markdown
# Phase 2: Tauri IPC & Optimization

## Findings
[Organized by severity]

## What's Done Well
[Positive observations]

## Key Issues for Frontend Context
[Findings that affect the frontend layer]
```

Update `state.json`: set `current_phase` to "checkpoint-1", add phase 2 to `completed_phases`.

---

## PHASE CHECKPOINT 1 -- User Approval Required

Display a summary of findings from Phases 1-2 and ask:

```
Phases 1-2 complete: Rust backend and Tauri IPC reviews done.

Summary:
- Rust Backend: [X critical, Y high, Z medium findings]
- Tauri IPC: [X critical, Y high, Z medium findings]

Please review:
- .tauri-pipeline/01-rust-review.md
- .tauri-pipeline/02-tauri-optimization.md

1. Continue -- proceed to React frontend performance review
2. Fix critical issues first -- I'll address backend findings before continuing
3. Pause -- save progress and stop here
```

If `--strict-mode` flag is set and there are Critical findings, recommend option 2.

If `--rust-only` flag is set, skip to **Completion** after this checkpoint.

Do NOT proceed to Phase 3 until the user approves.

---

## Phase 3: React Frontend Performance

**Skip if:** `--rust-only` flag is set.

Read `.tauri-pipeline/02-tauri-optimization.md` for IPC context.

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "react-performance-optimizer"
  description: "React frontend performance review for Tauri app"
  prompt: |
    Analyze the React frontend of this Tauri 2 desktop application for performance.

    ## Scope
    [Insert contents of .tauri-pipeline/00-scope.md — Frontend Files section]

    ## Tauri Context
    [Insert .tauri-pipeline/02-tauri-optimization.md — Key Issues for Frontend section]

    ## Instructions
    Analyze for:
    1. **Re-render optimization**: Unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, expensive computations in render
    2. **State management**: Global vs local state, state update batching, context overhead
    3. **IPC integration**: Are Tauri invoke calls debounced? Loading states? Error boundaries?
    4. **Bundle optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, tree shaking effectiveness
    5. **React patterns**: Hook dependencies, effect cleanup, key usage in lists
    6. **Desktop-specific**: Window resize handling, system tray integration, native menu sync
    7. **Data fetching**: Caching strategy for Tauri commands, stale data handling

    For each finding: severity, file, issue, concrete fix.
    Note what's done well.

    Write your findings as a structured markdown document.
```
