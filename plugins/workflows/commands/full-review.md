# Full Review Pipeline

## CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES

You MUST follow these rules exactly. Violating any of them is a failure.

1. **Execute phases in order.** Do NOT skip ahead, reorder, or merge phases.
2. **Write output files.** Each phase MUST produce its output file in `.full-review-pipeline/` before the next phase begins. Read from prior phase files -- do NOT rely on context window memory.
3. **Stop at checkpoints.** When you reach a `PHASE CHECKPOINT`, you MUST stop and wait for explicit user approval before continuing. Use the AskUserQuestion tool with clear options.
4. **Halt on failure.** If any step fails (agent error, missing files, access issues), STOP immediately. Present the error and ask the user how to proceed. Do NOT silently continue.
5. **Never enter plan mode autonomously.** Do NOT use EnterPlanMode. This command IS the plan -- execute it.

## Pre-flight Checks

### 0. Dependency check

This command requires agents, skills, and commands from other plugins. Before proceeding, verify they are installed:

**Required plugins:**
- `deep-dive-analysis` -- deep-dive-analysis skill/command (Phase 1)
- `senior-review` -- architect-review, security-auditor, pattern-quality-scorer agents (Phase 2)

Check by looking for the agent/skill files. If a required plugin is missing, STOP and tell the user:

```
Missing required plugin(s): [list]

This workflow command depends on agents and skills from other anvil-toolset plugins.
Install them with:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset --plugin <name>

Or install the full marketplace:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset
```

### 1. Check for existing session

Check if `.full-review-pipeline/state.json` exists:

- If it exists and `status` is `"in_progress"`: Read it, display the current phase, and ask:

  ```
  Found an in-progress full review pipeline session:
  Target: [target from state]
  Current phase: [phase from state]

  1. Resume from where we left off
  2. Start fresh (archives existing session)
  ```

- If it exists and `status` is `"complete"`: Ask whether to archive and start fresh.

### 2. Initialize state

Create `.full-review-pipeline/` directory and `state.json`:

```json
{
  "target": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "flags": {
    "skip_deep_dive": false,
    "security_focus": false,
    "performance_critical": false,
    "strict_mode": false,
    "framework": null
  },
  "current_phase": 1,
  "completed_phases": [],
  "files_created": [],
  "started_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "last_updated": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
}
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--skip-deep-dive`, `--security-focus`, `--performance-critical`, `--strict-mode`, and `--framework` flags.

### 3. Identify review target

Determine what code to review from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- If a file/directory path is given, verify it exists
- If a description is given (e.g., "recent changes", "authentication module"), identify the relevant files
- List the files that will be reviewed and confirm with the user

**Output file:** `.full-review-pipeline/00-scope.md`

```markdown
# Review Scope

## Target

[Description of what is being reviewed]

## Files

[List of files/directories included in the review]

## Flags

- Skip Deep Dive: [yes/no]
- Security Focus: [yes/no]
- Performance Critical: [yes/no]
- Strict Mode: [yes/no]
- Framework: [name or auto-detected]

## Pipeline Phases

1. Deep Dive Structural Analysis
2. Senior Code Review
   - 2A: Architecture Review
   - 2B: Security Vulnerability Assessment
   - 2C: Performance Analysis
   - 2D: Test Coverage Analysis
   - 2E: Documentation & API Review
   - 2F: Framework & Language Best Practices
   - 2G: CI/CD & DevOps Practices
   - 2H: Dead Code Analysis
   - 2I: Code Quality, Pattern Analysis & Scoring
3. Consolidated Report
```

Update `state.json`: add `"00-scope.md"` to `files_created`, add step 0 to `completed_phases`.

---

## Phase 1: Deep Dive Structural Analysis

**Skip if:** `--skip-deep-dive` flag is set. If skipped, proceed directly to Phase 2.

Run the deep-dive-analysis skill on the target path. This produces comprehensive structural and semantic understanding of the codebase that will enrich all subsequent review phases.

Spawn 4 agents in parallel using the Agent tool:

## Structure Highlights

[Key structural findings from dd-01-structure.md]

## Interface Contracts

[Key interface findings from dd-02-interfaces.md]

[Key flow findings from dd-03-flows-semantics.md]

## Risks & Technical Debt

[Key risk findings from dd-04-risks.md]

## Key Areas for Review Focus

[List of areas that need special attention in the code review phase, organized by concern type]
```

Update `state.json`: set `current_phase` to "checkpoint-1", add phase 1 to `completed_phases`.

---

## PHASE CHECKPOINT 1 -- User Approval Required

Display a summary of deep dive findings:

```
Phase 1 complete: Deep dive analysis done.

Summary:
- Files analyzed: [count]
- Modules identified: [count]
- Risks detected: [X critical, Y high, Z medium]
- Key areas flagged for review: [count]

Please review:
- .full-review-pipeline/01-deep-dive-summary.md
- .full-review-pipeline/dd-01-structure.md (structure)
- .full-review-pipeline/dd-02-interfaces.md (interfaces)
- .full-review-pipeline/dd-03-flows-semantics.md (flows)
- .full-review-pipeline/dd-04-risks.md (risks)

1. Continue -- proceed to senior code review (enriched with deep dive context)
2. Pause -- save progress and stop here
```

Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the user approves.

---

## Phase 2: Senior Code Review

Read `.full-review-pipeline/01-deep-dive-summary.md` and `.full-review-pipeline/00-scope.md` for full context.

This phase runs the senior-review process enriched with deep dive findings. All review agents receive the deep dive context to produce deeper, more targeted analysis.

### Deep Dive Context Injection

When deep dive was performed (not skipped), each review agent prompt in Phase 2 gets the relevant deep-dive findings injected:

- For architect-review (2A): structure, interfaces, flows, semantics
- For security-auditor (2B): flows (data paths), semantics (assumptions), risks
- For performance agent (2C): structure, flows
- For test/docs agents (2D, 2E): interfaces, flows, risks
- For best practices agents (2F): all deep-dive findings
- For CI/CD agent (2G): structure, risks
- For dead code agent (2H): structure, interfaces
- For pattern-quality-scorer (2I): all deep-dive findings

Use this context to strengthen analysis. Do NOT re-report findings already covered in the deep dive -- instead focus on new issues the deep dive missed or issues that become apparent when combining deep-dive context with the specialized perspective.

---

### Step 2A: Architecture Review (parallel with 2B)

Run steps 2A and 2B in parallel using multiple Agent tool calls in a single response.

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "senior-review:architect-review"
  description: "Architecture review enriched with deep dive context"
  prompt: |
    Review the architectural design and structural integrity of the target code.
    You have deep dive analysis context -- use it to go deeper than a surface-level review.

    ## Review Scope
    [Insert contents of .full-review-pipeline/00-scope.md]

    ## Deep Dive Context
    [Insert contents of .full-review-pipeline/01-deep-dive-summary.md]
    [Insert key findings from .full-review-pipeline/dd-01-structure.md and dd-03-flows-semantics.md]

    ## Instructions
    Evaluate:
    1. **Component boundaries**: Separation of concerns, module cohesion -- cross-reference with structural map
    2. **Dependency management**: Circular dependencies, coupling -- use the dependency graph from deep dive
    3. **API design**: Endpoint design, schemas, error contracts -- validate against interface analysis
    4. **Data model**: Schema design, relationships, access patterns
    5. **Design patterns**: Appropriate use, missing abstractions, over-engineering
    6. **Architectural consistency**: Does code follow established patterns identified in deep dive?
    7. **Flow integrity**: Do the traced execution paths reveal architectural weaknesses?

    For each finding:
    - Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
    - Architectural impact assessment
    - Specific improvement recommendation

    Do NOT re-report issues already in the deep dive risk report. Focus on architectural
    implications and new issues visible from your specialized perspective.

    Write your findings as a structured markdown document.
```

### Step 2B: Security Vulnerability Assessment (parallel with 2A)

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "senior-review:security-auditor"
  description: "Security audit enriched with deep dive context"

    ## Instructions
    Analyze:
    1. **OWASP Top 10**: Injection, broken auth, sensitive data exposure, XXE, broken access control, misconfig, XSS, insecure deserialization, vulnerable components, insufficient logging
    2. **Input validation**: Missing sanitization -- trace input paths from the flow analysis
    3. **Authentication/authorization**: Flawed logic, privilege escalation -- use the auth flow traces
    4. **Cryptographic issues**: Weak algorithms, hardcoded secrets, improper key management
    5. **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Known CVEs -- cross-reference with risk report
    6. **Configuration security**: Debug mode, verbose errors, permissive CORS, missing security headers
    7. **Data flow security**: Follow data from entry to storage using traced flows -- find where sanitization is missing

    For each finding:
    - Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low) with CVSS score if applicable
    - CWE reference where applicable
    - File and line location
    - Proof of concept or attack scenario
    - Specific remediation steps with code example

    Do NOT re-report security risks already in the deep dive risk report unless you have
    additional context or a more specific attack scenario.

    Write your findings as a structured markdown document.
```

    ## Instructions

    ### Context Assessment
    Determine the code's scope, maturity stage (prototype/production/legacy). Use prior phase findings
    to calibrate focus areas -- don't duplicate what's already been covered in detail.

    ### Code Quality Analysis
    1. **Code complexity**: Cyclomatic/cognitive complexity, deeply nested logic
    2. **Maintainability**: Naming conventions, function/method length, class cohesion
    3. **Code duplication**: Copy-pasted logic, missed abstraction opportunities
    4. **Clean Code principles**: SOLID violations, code smells, anti-patterns
    5. **Technical debt**: Areas that will become increasingly costly to change
    6. **Error handling**: Missing error handling, swallowed exceptions, unclear error messages

    ### Pattern Consistency Detection
    For each file, identify dominant patterns and flag deviations:
    - Error handling style (try/catch, Result types, error checks)
    - Resource management (using, defer, finally, context managers)
    - Import conventions (grouping, ordering)
    - Null/optional handling (defensive checks, optional chaining)
    - Async patterns (async/await vs callbacks vs blocking)

    Key question: "Is there an established pattern in this file that this code should follow but doesn't?"

    ### Anti-Pattern Checklist
    Flag any occurrences of: god objects, premature optimization, callback hell, mutable global state,
    swallowed exceptions, tight third-party coupling, missing validation on external data, sync I/O
    blocking event loops, DB queries in loops, missing transaction boundaries, no rollback on partial
    failures, TODO/FIXME in critical paths. Also flag consistency anti-patterns.

    ### Mental Models (all six perspectives)
    - **Security Engineer**: Assume all input is malicious
    - **Performance Engineer**: What's the Big-O? What's the I/O pattern?
    - **Team Lead**: Maintainable in 6 months? Can juniors understand it?
    - **Systems Architect**: How does this fail? Blast radius?
    - **SRE**: What breaks at 3 AM?
    - **Pattern Detective**: Dominant patterns per file, then scan for violations

    ### Quantitative Code Quality Score
    Rate each category using ALL findings from deep dive + all review phases combined:
    - **9-10**: Excellent -- production-ready, exemplary patterns
    - **7-8**: Good -- minor issues, safe to deploy
    - **5-6**: Adequate -- notable issues, fix before deploy
    - **3-4**: Poor -- significant issues, needs rework
    - **1-2**: Critical -- fundamental problems, unsafe

    Provide scores for: Security, Performance, Architecture, Maintainability, Testing, Documentation, and Overall.

    Write findings as structured markdown with Executive Summary, Code Quality Findings,
    Pattern Consistency Findings, What's Done Well, and the Code Quality Score table.
