# Mobile Intelligence Pipeline

## CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES

You MUST follow these rules exactly. Violating any of them is a failure.

1. **Execute phases in order.** Do NOT skip ahead, reorder, or merge phases.
2. **Write output files.** Each phase MUST produce its output file in `.mobile-intel/` before the next phase begins. Read from prior phase files -- do NOT rely on context window memory.
3. **Stop at checkpoints.** When you reach a `PHASE CHECKPOINT`, you MUST stop and wait for explicit user approval before continuing. Use the AskUserQuestion tool with clear options.
4. **Halt on failure.** If any step fails (agent error, ADB connection, missing files), STOP immediately. Present the error and ask the user how to proceed. Do NOT silently continue.
5. **Never enter plan mode autonomously.** Do NOT use EnterPlanMode. This command IS the plan -- execute it.
6. **Brainstorming is interactive.** Phase 2 MUST involve back-and-forth with the user -- ask questions one at a time, propose approaches, get approval.

## Pre-flight Checks

### 0. Dependency check

This command requires agents and skills from other plugins. Before proceeding, verify they are installed:

**Required plugins:**
- `app-analyzer` -- app-analyzer agent (Phase 1)
- `frontend` -- web-designer agent (Phase 3)
- `ai-tooling` -- brainstorming, writing-plans skills (Phases 2, 4)

**Optional plugins:**
- `tauri-development` -- tauri-mobile skill (Phase 5, skip scaffold if missing)

Check by looking for the agent/skill files. If a required plugin is missing, STOP and tell the user:

```
Missing required plugin(s): [list]

This workflow command depends on agents and skills from other anvil-toolset plugins.
Install them with:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset --plugin <name>

Or install the full marketplace:
  claude plugin marketplace add acaprino/anvil-toolset
```

If only `tauri-development` is missing, warn but continue (treat as `--skip-scaffold`).

### 1. Verify ADB connection

```bash
adb devices
```

- If no devices listed: STOP and tell the user to connect a device or start an emulator.
- If `--device <device-id>` flag is provided, verify that specific device is connected.
- If multiple devices and no `--device` flag, ask the user which device to use.

### 2. Check for existing session

Check if `.mobile-intel/state.json` exists:

- If it exists and `status` is `"in_progress"`: Read it, display the current phase, and ask:
  ```
  Found an in-progress mobile intelligence session:
  Target: [target from state]
  Current phase: [phase from state]

  1. Resume from where we left off
  2. Start fresh (archives existing session)
  ```
- If it exists and `status` is `"complete"`: Ask whether to archive and start fresh.

### 3. Initialize state

Create `.mobile-intel/` directory and `state.json`:

```json
{
  "target": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "flags": {
    "device": null,
    "skip_scaffold": false
  },
  "current_phase": 1,
  "completed_phases": [],
  "files_created": [],
  "started_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "last_updated": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
}
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--device` and `--skip-scaffold` flags.

---

## Phase 1: Competitor App Analysis

Use the app-analyzer agent to analyze the target app via ADB.

### Process

1. **Launch the target app** on the connected device:
   ```bash
   adb shell monkey -p <package-name> -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
   ```

2. **Navigate key screens** — for each screen:
   - Capture screenshot: `adb exec-out screencap -p > .mobile-intel/screenshots/screen-NN.png`
   - Record the screen name, purpose, and UI elements observed
   - Note navigation patterns, gestures, transitions

3. **Document the following:**
   - App architecture (tab-based, drawer, stack navigation)
   - Key user flows (onboarding, core action, settings)
   - UX patterns (loading states, error handling, empty states)
   - Design language (colors, typography, spacing, icons)
   - Unique features and differentiators
   - Pain points and UX friction

**Output file:** `.mobile-intel/01-competitor-analysis.md`

```markdown

1. Continue -- proceed to brainstorming differentiating features
2. Capture more screens -- I need to analyze additional app areas
3. Pause -- save progress and stop here
```

Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the user approves.

---

## Phase 2: Brainstorm Differentiating Features

Read `.mobile-intel/01-competitor-analysis.md` for full context.

Follow the brainstorming skill process — this phase is **interactive**:

### Step 2A: Explore context

Review the competitor analysis findings. Identify the biggest opportunities based on the competitor's weaknesses and pain points.

### Step 2B: Ask clarifying questions (one at a time)

Ask the user questions to understand their vision:

- What is the target audience for your app?
- Which of the competitor's weaknesses are most important to address?
- Are there features you definitely want to include or exclude?
- What's the app's primary differentiator?
- What's the target platform priority (Android-first, iOS-first, both)?

Use AskUserQuestion with multiple-choice options where possible. One question per message.

### Step 2C: Propose approaches

Based on the analysis and user answers, propose 2-3 differentiation strategies:

- Feature parity + UX improvements
- Niche focus with fewer but better features
- Platform-native features the competitor doesn't leverage

Lead with your recommendation and explain why.

### Step 2D: Present design

Present the brainstormed feature set organized by priority:

- Must-have features (v1)
- Nice-to-have features (v1.1)
- Future considerations (v2)

Get user approval.

Read `.mobile-intel/04-implementation-plan.md` for the implementation plan.

Use the tauri-mobile skill guidance to scaffold the project:

### Step 5A: Initialize Tauri 2 project

Follow the tauri-mobile skill process:
- Create project with `npm create tauri-app@latest` or equivalent
- Configure for mobile targets (Android and/or iOS)
- Set up the project structure from the implementation plan

### Step 5B: Configure mobile capabilities

- Set up Android manifest permissions
- Configure Tauri capabilities for mobile plugins
- Add required Tauri plugins (biometric, geolocation, notifications, etc.)

### Step 5C: Create base architecture

- Set up frontend framework (React + TypeScript)
- Create navigation structure from UX design
- Add state management foundation
- Create IPC command stubs matching the plan
