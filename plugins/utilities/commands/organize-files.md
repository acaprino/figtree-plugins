$ARGUMENTS

**Safety**: the skill always proposes a plan and asks for approval before moving or deleting anything. Destructive operations (duplicate removal, file deletion) require explicit confirmation per batch.

## Quick Examples

- `/organize-files Downloads` - Organize Downloads folder by file type
- `/organize-files ~/Documents find duplicates` - Find and remove duplicate files
- `/organize-files ~/Projects archive old` - Archive inactive projects
- `/organize-files . cleanup` - Clean up current directory
