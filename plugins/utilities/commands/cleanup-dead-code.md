# Cleanup Dead Code

Detect and remove unused code. Auto-detects the project language and dispatches to the appropriate skill.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Git pre-flight**: before any analysis, check `git status`. If the working tree has uncommitted changes, warn the user and suggest committing or stashing first -- this ensures safe `git restore` if anything goes wrong.
2. **Run tests before and after.** Establish a baseline, then verify no regressions.
3. **If `--dry-run`, report only.** Show findings without modifying files.
4. **Revert on test failure.** If any test fails after a change, undo it immediately.
5. **Never remove code that is used via side effects.** Check dynamic imports, decorators, and framework conventions.
6. **Python functions/classes require approval.** Vulture has high false-positive rates for functions and classes (metaprogramming, framework conventions). Present these separately and get explicit user confirmation before removing. Unused imports (ruff F401) and unused variables (ruff F841) are safe to auto-remove.

## Step 1: Detect Language

```bash
# Check for TS/JS project
ls package.json 2>/dev/null

# Check for Python project
ls pyproject.toml setup.py setup.cfg 2>/dev/null
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*.py" -print -quit 2>/dev/null
```

### Decision tree

**Knip mode** (TS/JS) - `package.json` exists:
- Proceed to Step 2A

**Python mode** - `*.py` files, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py` exist (no `package.json`):
- Proceed to Step 2B

**Both exist** - ask the user which to analyze, or run both sequentially.

## Step 2A: Knip Analysis (TypeScript/JavaScript)

Invoke the `knip` skill from `typescript-development`. Pass through any flags from `$ARGUMENTS` (`--dependencies-only`, `--exports-only`, `--production`, path).

Fallback if skill unavailable:
```bash
bunx knip 2>/dev/null || npx knip
```

Proceed to Step 3 with Knip findings.

## Step 2B: Python Analysis (vulture + ruff)

Invoke the `python-dead-code` skill from `python-development`. Pass through any path from `$ARGUMENTS`.

Fallback if skill unavailable:
```bash
uv run vulture [target] --min-confidence 80 2>/dev/null || vulture [target] --min-confidence 80
uv run ruff check [target] --select F401,F841 2>/dev/null || ruff check [target] --select F401,F841
```

Proceed to Step 3 with Python findings.

## Step 3: Present Findings

Categorize and display all findings by type (unused imports, variables, functions, classes, dependencies, exports, files). Include file:line locations.

If `--dry-run`, stop here.

## Step 4: Establish Test Baseline

Inspect available test commands before running blindly:
```bash
# TS/JS: check package.json scripts for the right test command
# Prefer unit tests over e2e -- avoid triggering Playwright/Cypress accidentally
cat package.json | grep -A 5 '"scripts"'
# Then run the appropriate test command (e.g., npm run test:unit, vitest run, jest)

# Python
pytest -v 2>/dev/null || python -m pytest -v 2>/dev/null
```

If no tests exist, warn and ask whether to proceed with manual verification or cancel.

## Step 5: Apply Cleanup

Apply changes in safest-first order:
- **TS/JS**: unused dependencies -> unused exports -> unused types -> unused files
- **Python**: unused imports -> unused variables -> unused functions/classes

For each change, verify no dynamic imports, side-effect usage, or framework conventions. Remove in small batches and validate.

## Step 6: Validate & Report

Re-run tests. If any fail, revert the last batch. Present a summary of what was removed and test status.

## What It Does

- **TypeScript/JavaScript (Knip)**: Finds unused dependencies, exports, files, and types. See the `knip` skill for details.
- **Python (vulture + ruff)**: Finds unused imports, variables, functions, classes, and unreachable code. See the `python-dead-code` skill for details.

## What It Does NOT Do

- Remove code used via side effects, dynamic imports, or reflection
- Modify framework-convention files (Next.js pages/, Django views, pytest fixtures)
- Remove dependencies used only in scripts
- Touch test files unless they reference removed symbols
