# MetaTrader 5 Python Algotrading

Knowledge base for building production-grade algorithmic trading systems with MetaTrader 5 Python API.

## When to Use

- Connecting to MT5 terminal via the official Python API
- Building polling-based event systems (on_tick, on_new_candle, on_position)
- Executing orders with correct fill modes (FOK, IOC, Return)
- Downloading historical data (copy_rates, copy_ticks)
- Handling MT5 disconnections and terminal restarts
- Deploying MT5 bots on Windows with process monitoring
- Choosing between official API, aiomql, and ZeroMQ bridge

## Quick Start

For 80% of use cases, start with:
1. **Library**: `pip install MetaTrader5` (official) or `pip install aiomql` (async wrapper)
2. **Connection**: `mt5.initialize(path=..., login=..., server=..., password=...)`
3. **Event system**: polling loop with candle/tick/position change detection
4. **Orders**: `order_check()` before `order_send()`, always detect fill mode dynamically
5. **Risk**: server-side SL/TP on every position (non-negotiable)
6. **Resilience**: health check every 30-60s, psutil process monitoring, exponential backoff

Then harden incrementally:
- Silent errors -- wrap every API call with None check + last_error()
- Fill mode rejections (10030) -- dynamic filling_mode detection per symbol
- Terminal crashes -- psutil watchdog + subprocess restart
- Weekend handling -- datetime.weekday() sleep mode

## Reference Materials

- `api-architecture.md` -- MT5 Python API architecture, 32 functions, named pipes IPC, MQL5 EA vs Python, library comparison
- `event-system-polling.md` -- polling patterns, new candle detection, tick monitoring, position tracking, concurrency rules
- `order-execution.md` -- order_send, fill modes (FOK/IOC/Return), hedging vs netting, retcodes, risk checks, magic numbers
- `data-feed-historical.md` -- copy_rates, copy_ticks, depth, timezone caveats, caching, data quality, broker differences
- `production-resilience.md` -- disconnection handling, reconnection, weekend management, Windows deployment, community resources

## Key Decision Points

| Decision | Default | Upgrade When |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Library | Official MetaTrader5 | Need async -- aiomql; need true streaming -- ZeroMQ bridge |
| Event model | Polling (1-5s interval) | Tick-sensitive -- poll 100-250ms; true events -- ZeroMQ EA bridge |
| Fill mode | Detect dynamically per symbol | Never hardcode -- changes between brokers/symbols |
| Account mode | Hedging (most forex brokers) | Check account_info().margin_mode at startup |
| Data caching | Parquet + Zstandard | Tick data -- partition by day/month |
| Concurrency | asyncio (single thread) | Multi-account -- separate processes per terminal |
| Backtesting | Python framework (Backtrader, Backtesting.py) | Need MT5 tester -- MQL5 EA wrapper |
| SL/TP | Server-side always | Python trailing only as supplement, never as sole protection |
