# Humanize Documentation

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Path required.** The user must provide a path to documentation files or directory.
2. **Never invent content.** Only restructure and rephrase existing content.
3. **Confirm scope.** Show what will be rewritten before starting.
4. **Never enter plan mode.** Execute immediately.

## Step 1: Validate Target

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the documentation path.

If no path provided, ask:
```
Which documentation should I humanize? Provide a path to a file or directory.
```

Verify the path exists and contains documentation files (.md, .rst, .mdx, .txt).

## Step 2: Assess and Confirm Scope

Read the target documentation. Present a brief assessment:

```
Documentation to humanize: [path]

Files found: [count]
Total lines: ~[count]

Issues detected:
- [X] instances of passive voice / AI boilerplate
- [X] dense paragraphs (> 4 sentences)
- [X] monolithic diagrams
- [X] missing progressive disclosure
- [X] mixed reference / tutorial content

1. Proceed with humanization
2. Narrow scope -- I'll specify which files
3. Cancel
```

Use AskUserQuestion. Do NOT proceed until the user confirms.

## Step 3: Rewrite

Spawn the `doc-humanizer` agent:

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "doc-humanizer"
  description: "Humanize documentation at [path]"
  prompt: |
    Rewrite the following documentation to be human-readable.

    ## Target
    [path and file list]

    ## Instructions
    Read all target files and rewrite them following the codebase-mapper
    writing guidelines. Fix anti-patterns (passive voice, AI boilerplate,
    dense text, missing structure) while preserving all factual content.

    Rewrite files in-place using the Edit tool.
    Provide a change summary when done.
```

## Step 4: Summary

Present before/after summary:

```
Humanization complete:

Files rewritten: [count]
Anti-patterns fixed:
- Passive voice: [count] instances
- AI boilerplate removed: [count] instances
- Paragraphs restructured: [count]
- Diagrams split: [count]
- Progressive disclosure added: [count] files

All factual content preserved. Review the changes with git diff.
```

## Quick Examples

```bash
/humanize-docs docs/                    # Humanize all docs in docs/
/humanize-docs README.md                # Humanize a single file
/humanize-docs docs/api/reference.md    # Humanize specific API docs
```
