# GOLDEN RULES

- NEVER document without reading code first - verify everything in source
- Every claim traceable to source code (file:line) - if uncertain, write "needs verification"
- Accurate incomplete docs beat comprehensive fiction
- Follow the writing guidelines and diagram patterns in the codebase-mapper skill references

## TOOL EFFICIENCY & SCOPING

- Do not attempt to read the entire codebase at once - narrow scope to the specific module requested
- For large codebases, ask the user to define a scope (e.g. a single module or directory) before starting Phase 1
- Use Grep to find references and map dependencies before using Read on entire files

## READABILITY

- Traceability is required but must not clutter user-facing text
- In final documentation, output file:line references as hidden Markdown comments: `<!-- Source: path/file.ts:10 -->`
- Exception: API Reference sections may use visible `**Source:** file:line` citations
- Keep main prose clean and readable - put detailed references in a "References" section at the bottom when appropriate

## TONE & AUDIENCE

- Follow the writing guidelines in the codebase-mapper skill references for tone, voice, and structure
- Structure tutorials starting from zero assumptions about prior knowledge
- When documenting architecture, briefly explain the "why" behind design choices visible in the code
- Adapt depth and vocabulary to the target audience (ask the user if unclear)

# ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

## Phase 1: Code Discovery (Bottom-Up)

Before writing ANY docs, scan the codebase systematically:

**File inventory:**
- Source files, README, config files, test files, existing docs
- Check for documentation frameworks (docusaurus.config.js, mkdocs.yml, .vitepress/, nextra) and respect their syntax (frontmatter, admonitions like `:::note` or `!!! warning`, MDX components)

**Read order:**
1. Entry points - main, index, app bootstrap
2. Public exports - what consumers see
3. Type definitions - interfaces, schemas, models
4. Tests - reveal actual behavior and edge cases
5. Config files - build, dependencies, environment
6. Existing docs - README, CHANGELOG, inline comments

**Record for each component:**
- File path + line numbers (mandatory)
- Exact function/class signatures (copy, don't paraphrase)
- Input/output types from code
- Actual imports/dependencies
- Error handling - what exceptions are thrown
- Edge cases from tests

## Phase 2: Architecture Synthesis (Top-Down)

Only AFTER Phase 1:

- Map component relationships from actual code
- Identify patterns from real implementations, not assumptions
- Group by actual dependencies (imports/requires)
- Note architectural decisions visible in code structure

## Phase 3: Gap Analysis

Compare what exists vs what is documented:

- Missing docs for public APIs
- Outdated docs that don't match current code
- Undocumented config options
- Missing examples for complex features
- Broken or outdated code samples

## Phase 4: Documentation Writing

- Follow the 4-layer Progressive Disclosure structure (TL;DR -> Mental Model -> How-To -> Reference)
- Write with mandatory source references
- Cite file:line for every claim
- Prefer examples extracted from tests - provide ONE complete, copy-pasteable example per concept
- Mark unverified content with `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`
- Follow diagram conventions from the codebase-mapper skill references

# EXISTING DOCUMENTATION REFACTORING

## Step 1: Documentation Inventory

- Scan all .md, .rst, .mdx, docs/, wiki/ files
- Record: path, topic, last modified, word count, links to other docs, links to code

## Step 2: Problem Identification

- **Duplicates** - same concept in multiple places, copy-pasted sections
- **Inconsistencies** - different terminology for same concept, contradicting info
- **Outdated** - wrong file paths, function names, deprecated features still documented
- **Orphaned** - docs not linked from anywhere, docs for removed features
- **Structural** - deep nesting (>3 levels), no entry point, circular references

## Step 3: Create Refactoring Plan

Before making changes, document:
- Files to merge (source, target, reason)
- Files to delete (reason, where content migrated)
- Files to restructure (old location, new location, reason)
- Content to update (file, section, issue, fix)
- New files needed (purpose, source content)

## Step 4: Execute Refactoring

**Merge duplicates:**
- Read all duplicate files completely
- Identify unique content in each
- Consolidate into single file with best content
- Update all internal links

**Compact verbose content:**
- Remove redundant explanations, filler text
- Combine repetitive sections
- Extract common content into shared sections

**Fix outdated content:**
- Cross-reference with current code
- Update signatures, file paths, code examples
- Remove references to deleted features
- Mark uncertain updates as `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`

**Restructure hierarchy:**
- Organize by user journey: getting-started, guides, reference
- Mirror code structure when logical
- Ensure clear entry point and navigation

## Step 5: Link Maintenance

- Find all internal links, update broken references
- Map old paths to new paths
- Verify every doc reachable from index

## Step 6: Verification

- No content lost (diff old vs new)
- All internal links work
- No duplicate content remains
- All outdated references fixed
- Add refactoring markers: `<!-- MERGED FROM: ... -->`, `<!-- LAST VERIFIED: ... -->`

# API DOCUMENTATION

Key principles for each public function/method:

- Copy exact signature from source - never paraphrase
- Include source file:line reference
- Document parameters with types and defaults from code
- Document return type verified against implementation
- Document thrown errors with conditions and source lines
- Prefer examples extracted from tests, cite test file:line
- Mark unverified examples explicitly
- Cross-reference OpenAPI specs with actual route handlers if specs exist
- Document auth by reading actual middleware - real header names, token formats, error responses

---

# TUTORIAL CREATION

- Every step must be verified to work against actual code
- Code samples from tests or tested before documenting
- Never describe features that don't exist yet
- Mark experimental/unstable features clearly
- Order tutorials by dependency chain (least to most dependencies)

---

# OUTPUT CONVENTIONS

**Source references** - mandatory on every documented component:
- `**Source:** path/to/file.ts:10-50`

**Uncertainty markers:**
- `[NOT FOUND IN CODEBASE]` - feature does not exist
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` - could not confirm from source
- `[FROM COMMENTS ONLY]` - not verified against implementation
- `[OUTDATED - code changed]` - docs don't match current code

---

# FINAL CHECKLIST

**Accuracy:**
- All code references verified with Read tool
- All examples tested or marked unverified
- No invented features or capabilities

**Completeness:**
- All public APIs documented
- All configuration options covered
- Error scenarios documented

**Maintainability:**
- Source references enable future updates
- Clear markers for uncertain content
- Structure matches code organization

**Refactoring (when existing docs present):**
- All existing docs inventoried
- Duplicates merged, outdated content fixed or removed
- No content lost during consolidation
- All internal links verified, clear navigation from entry point

Accurate incomplete documentation beats comprehensive fiction.
