# Comprehensive Code Review Orchestrator

## CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES

You MUST follow these rules exactly. Violating any of them is a failure.

1. **Execute phases in order.** Do NOT skip ahead, reorder, or merge phases.
2. **Write output files.** Each phase MUST produce its output file in `.full-review/` before the next phase begins. Read from prior phase files -- do NOT rely on context window memory.
3. **Stop at checkpoints.** When you reach a `PHASE CHECKPOINT`, you MUST stop and wait for explicit user approval before continuing. Use the AskUserQuestion tool with clear options.
4. **Halt on failure.** If any step fails (agent error, missing files, access issues), STOP immediately. Present the error and ask the user how to proceed. Do NOT silently continue.
5. **Use only local agents.** All `subagent_type` references use agents bundled with this plugin or `general-purpose`. No cross-plugin dependencies.
6. **Never enter plan mode autonomously.** Do NOT use EnterPlanMode. This command IS the plan -- execute it.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before starting, perform these checks:

### 1. Check for existing session

Check if `.full-review/state.json` exists:

- If it exists and `status` is `"in_progress"`: Read it, display the current phase, and ask the user:

  ```
  Found an in-progress review session:
  Target: [target from state]
  Current phase: [phase from state]

  1. Resume from where we left off
  2. Start fresh (archives existing session)
  ```

- If it exists and `status` is `"complete"`: Ask whether to archive and start fresh.

### 2. Initialize state

Create `.full-review/` directory and `state.json`:

```json
{
  "target": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "flags": {
    "security_focus": false,
    "performance_critical": false,
    "strict_mode": false,
    "framework": null
  },
  "current_step": 1,
  "current_phase": 1,
  "completed_steps": [],
  "files_created": [],
  "started_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "last_updated": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
}
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--security-focus`, `--performance-critical`, `--strict-mode`, and `--framework` flags. Update the flags object accordingly.

### 3. Identify review target

Determine what code to review from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- If a file/directory path is given, verify it exists
- If a description is given (e.g., "recent changes", "authentication module"), identify the relevant files
- List the files that will be reviewed and confirm with the user

**Output file:** `.full-review/00-scope.md`

```markdown
# Review Scope

## Target

[Description of what is being reviewed]

## Files

[List of files/directories included in the review]

## Flags

- Security Focus: [yes/no]
- Performance Critical: [yes/no]
- Strict Mode: [yes/no]
- Framework: [name or auto-detected]

## Review Phases

1. Architecture Review
2. Security & Performance
3. Testing & Documentation
4. Best Practices & Standards
5. Code Quality, Pattern Analysis & Scoring
6. Consolidated Report
```

Update `state.json`: add `"00-scope.md"` to `files_created`, add step 0 to `completed_steps`.

---

## Phase 5: Code Quality, Pattern Analysis & Scoring (Step 5)

Read all `.full-review/*.md` files (01 through 04) for full context before analyzing.

### Step 5: Code Quality, Pattern Consistency & Scoring

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "pattern-quality-scorer"
  description: "Code quality, pattern analysis and scoring for $ARGUMENTS"
  prompt: |
    Perform a comprehensive code quality review, pattern consistency analysis, and quantitative scoring.
    You have access to all prior phase findings — use them as context for calibrated, holistic scoring.

    ## Review Scope
    [Insert contents of .full-review/00-scope.md]

    ## Prior Phase Context
    [Insert summaries from .full-review/01-architecture.md, .full-review/02-security-performance.md,
     .full-review/03-testing-documentation.md, .full-review/04-best-practices.md]

    ## Instructions

    ### Context Assessment
    Determine the code's scope, maturity stage (prototype/production/legacy). Use prior phase findings
    to calibrate focus areas — don't duplicate what's already been covered in detail.

    ### Code Quality Analysis
    Analyze the target code for:
    1. **Code complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, deeply nested logic
    2. **Maintainability**: Naming conventions, function/method length, class cohesion
    3. **Code duplication**: Copy-pasted logic, missed abstraction opportunities
    4. **Clean Code principles**: SOLID violations, code smells, anti-patterns
    5. **Technical debt**: Areas that will become increasingly costly to change
    6. **Error handling**: Missing error handling, swallowed exceptions, unclear error messages

    ### Pattern Consistency Detection
    For each file, identify the dominant patterns and flag deviations:
    - Error handling style (try/catch, Result types, error checks)
    - Resource management (using, defer, finally, context managers)
    - Import conventions (grouping, ordering)
    - Null/optional handling (defensive checks, optional chaining)
    - Async patterns (async/await vs callbacks vs blocking)

    Key question: "Is there an established pattern in this file that this code should follow but doesn't?"

    ### Anti-Pattern Checklist
    Flag any occurrences of: god objects, premature optimization, callback hell, mutable global state,
    swallowed exceptions, tight third-party coupling, missing validation on external data, sync I/O
    blocking event loops, DB queries in loops, missing transaction boundaries, no rollback on partial
    failures, TODO/FIXME in critical paths. Also flag consistency anti-patterns.

    ### Mental Models
    Apply all six perspectives:
    - **Security Engineer**: Assume all input is malicious
    - **Performance Engineer**: What's the Big-O? What's the I/O pattern?
    - **Team Lead**: Maintainable in 6 months? Can juniors understand it?
    - **Systems Architect**: How does this fail? Blast radius?
    - **SRE**: What breaks at 3 AM?
    - **Pattern Detective**: Dominant patterns per file, then scan for violations

    ### Quantitative Code Quality Score
    Rate each category using ALL findings from all phases combined:
    - **9-10**: Excellent — production-ready, exemplary patterns
    - **7-8**: Good — minor issues, safe to deploy
    - **5-6**: Adequate — notable issues need attention before deploy
    - **3-4**: Poor — significant issues, needs rework
    - **1-2**: Critical — fundamental problems, unsafe

    Provide scores for: Security, Performance, Maintainability, Testing, and an Overall score.

    Write your findings as a structured markdown document with an Executive Summary, Code Quality Findings,
    Pattern Consistency Findings, What's Done Well, and the Code Quality Score table.
```

Write output to `.full-review/05-quality-scoring.md`:

```markdown
