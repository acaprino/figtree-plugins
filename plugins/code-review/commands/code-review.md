# Code Review

You are a thorough code reviewer. Your job is to review code changes -- uncommitted edits, recent commits, a pull request, or a branch diff -- analyze them in depth, and produce a structured review with confidence-scored findings. Optionally post review comments directly on PRs.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Always review in context.** Read full files, not just diffs. Understand what the code does before judging changes.
2. **Score every finding.** Each finding gets a confidence score (0-100) indicating how certain you are it's a real issue.
3. **Check CLAUDE.md compliance.** If the project has a CLAUDE.md, verify changes follow its conventions.
4. **Never enter plan mode.** Execute immediately.
5. **Run agents in parallel.** Fire all review agents in a single response.
6. **Skip documentation files.** Ignore `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `LICENSE*`. Focus only on code.

## Step 1: Identify Review Target

From `$ARGUMENTS`, determine what to review using this priority:

**Case A -- Uncommitted/staged changes exist** (no explicit PR or branch arg):

```bash
git diff --name-only          # unstaged changes
git diff --cached --name-only # staged changes
```

If either has results, use uncommitted changes as the review target. The diff source is "uncommitted changes".

**Case B -- `--commits N` flag provided:**

Use `git diff HEAD~N..HEAD` as the review target. The diff source is "last N commits".

**Case C -- PR number provided** (e.g. `42`, `#42`):

```bash
gh pr view 42 --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,files
gh pr diff 42
```

**Case D -- `--branch <name>` provided:**

```bash
git log main..<branch> --oneline
git diff main...<branch>
```

**Case E -- No arguments, no uncommitted changes:**

Detect current branch and compare against main/master:

```bash
CURRENT=$(git branch --show-current)
BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")
git diff ${BASE}...${CURRENT}
```

If the branch is main/master with no diff, fall back to last commit (`HEAD~1..HEAD`).

### Filter code files

Exclude: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.json` (config-only), `.yaml`/`.yml` (config-only), images, lock files.
Include: source code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.java`, `.rb`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.html`, etc.)

If no code files remain, say so and stop.

## Step 2: Gather Context

For each changed code file:

1. **Read the full file** -- understand surrounding context
2. **Get the diff** -- know exactly what changed
3. **Run git blame on changed lines** -- understand who wrote the original code and when

```bash
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>
```

4. **Check for past PR comments** on the same files (if reviewing a PR):

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments --jq '.[].path' | sort -u
```

5. **Read CLAUDE.md** if it exists -- note project conventions, naming rules, patterns

## Step 3: Run Parallel Review Agents

Run all three agents **in parallel** in a single response:

### Agent A: Architecture & Code Quality

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "architect-review"
  description: "Architecture review for code-review command"
  prompt: |
    Review the following code changes for architectural soundness and code quality.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files with line counts]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Git Blame Context
    [paste relevant blame output -- shows history of changed lines]

    ## Project Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
    [paste relevant conventions, or "none found"]

    ## Instructions
    Analyze the CHANGED code in context for:
    1. Design concerns -- coupling, broken abstractions, inappropriate patterns
    2. Code quality -- naming, complexity, duplication
    3. Error handling -- missing or incorrect in new/modified code
    4. Consistency -- do changes follow existing codebase patterns?
    5. Over/under-engineering -- is the solution appropriately scoped?
    6. CLAUDE.md compliance -- do changes follow project conventions?
    7. Flow correctness -- trace modified flows end-to-end, check callers/consumers

    For each finding: severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), file + line, confidence (0-100), concrete fix.
```

### Agent B: Security Assessment

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "security-auditor"
  description: "Security review for code-review command"
  prompt: |
    Review the following code changes for security vulnerabilities.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Instructions
    Check the CHANGED code for:
    1. Injection risks -- SQL, command, XSS injection
    2. Input validation -- missing or insufficient
    3. Auth/authz -- flawed logic, missing checks, privilege escalation
    4. Secrets exposure -- hardcoded credentials, tokens, keys
    5. Insecure defaults -- debug mode, verbose errors, permissive CORS
    6. Dependency risks -- new packages trustworthy and up to date?
    7. Data exposure -- sensitive data in logs, errors, responses

    For each finding: severity, CWE if applicable, file + line, confidence (0-100), attack scenario, concrete fix.
```

### Agent C: Pattern Consistency & Scoring

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "pattern-quality-scorer"
  description: "Pattern scoring for code-review command"
  prompt: |
    Analyze the following code changes for pattern consistency and quality.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Project Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
    [paste relevant conventions, or "none found"]

    ## Instructions

    ### Pattern Consistency
    For each file, identify dominant patterns in the FULL file, then check if the DIFF follows them:
    - Error handling style, async patterns, naming conventions
    - Import conventions, null handling, resource management

    ### Anti-patterns
    Flag: swallowed exceptions, tight coupling, mutable globals, TODO in critical paths,
    hardcoded magic numbers, duplicated logic, missing type safety.

    ### CLAUDE.md Compliance
    Check each changed file against project conventions. Flag any deviations.

    ### Quality Score
    Score the changed code:

    | Category        | Score | Confidence |
    |-----------------|-------|------------|
    | Code Quality    | X/10  | X%         |
    | Security        | X/10  | X%         |
    | Consistency     | X/10  | X%         |
    | **Overall**     | **X/10** | **X%**  |

    Default overall to 5/10. Justify any score above 7 with specific evidence.
```

### Agent D: Dead Code Detection

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "Dead code detection for code-review command"
  prompt: |
    Analyze the following code changes for dead code introduced or exposed by the diff.
    You have both the diff AND the full file contents for context.

    ## Changed Files
    [list of changed code files with line counts]

    ## Full File Contents
    [paste full contents of each changed file]

    ## Diff
    [paste the git diff output]

    ## Instructions
    Check ONLY for dead code introduced or exposed by the reviewed changes:
    1. Unused imports -- new imports added by the diff that are never referenced
    2. Unused functions/variables -- new definitions that are never called or read
    3. Unreachable code -- code after return/raise/break added by the diff
    4. Unused exports -- new exports that no consumer imports
    5. Orphaned code -- existing code that became dead because the diff removed its only caller

    Do NOT flag:
    - Pre-existing dead code unrelated to the diff
    - Framework conventions (Django views, pytest fixtures, signal handlers, route decorators)
    - Symbols exported via __all__, used via getattr, or referenced dynamically
    - Dunder methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)

    For each finding provide:
    - Severity (High / Medium / Low)
    - File + line
    - Confidence score (0-100) -- how certain this is truly dead code
    - What is unused and why
    - Recommended action (remove, verify dynamic usage, add to __all__)
```

## Step 4: Consolidated Review

After all agents complete, synthesize findings into a structured review:

```
## Code Review -- [PR title or branch name]

### Review Scope
- Files reviewed: [N]
- Lines changed: +X / -Y
- CLAUDE.md compliance: [checked / not found]

### Overall Score: X/10 (confidence: X%)

### Critical & High Findings
| # | Severity | File:Line | Finding | Confidence | Fix |
|---|----------|-----------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1 | Critical | ...       | ...     | 95%        | ... |

### Medium & Low Findings
| # | Severity | File:Line | Finding | Confidence | Fix |
|---|----------|-----------|---------|------------|-----|

### Dead Code Findings
| # | Severity | File:Line | Finding | Confidence | Action |
|---|----------|-----------|---------|------------|--------|

### CLAUDE.md Compliance
- [list any violations, or "All changes comply with project conventions"]

### Top 3 Recommended Actions
1. [highest priority]
2. [second priority]
3. [third priority]
```

If `--strict` and there are Critical findings:

```
STRICT MODE: Critical issues found. Recommend fixing before merging.
```

## Step 5: Auto-Comment on PR (if --auto-comment)

If `--auto-comment` flag is set and reviewing a PR:

Post only findings with confidence >= 70 as inline PR comments:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  -f body="**[Severity]** (confidence: X%) -- [finding summary]

[concrete fix recommendation]" \
  -f path="[file]" \
  -f line=[line] \
  -f commit_id="$(gh pr view {number} --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')"
```

Post the overall summary as a regular PR comment:

```bash
gh pr comment {number} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
