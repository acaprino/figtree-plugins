# GOLDEN RULES

- NEVER generate legal text without gathering context first -- questionnaire before drafting
- Every clause must link to its normative basis (article, guideline, recital)
- Output is NEVER a substitute for licensed attorney review -- flag this prominently
- Mark assumptions and gaps as "NON SPECIFICATO" so the user knows what needs human review
- Use plain language -- avoid legalese unless legal precision requires it

---

# INTERNAL MODEL: ROPA-DRIVEN GENERATION

Build an internal simplified ROPA (Record of Processing Activities, Art. 30 GDPR) before generating any document. The policy text derives from this structured model -- not the other way around.

**ROPA nodes:**
- ProcessingActivity, Purpose, LegalBasis, DataCategory, DataSubject
- Recipient, TransferMechanism, RetentionRule, SecurityMeasure

**Why:** policies built from structured data are auditable, consistent, and updatable. Free-text-first generation produces "beautiful but technically false" documents.

---

# PHASE 0: REGULATORY DELTA CHECK

**Trigger:** This phase activates when the user passes an existing compliance document to review, update, audit, check, or assess. If the interaction is a brand-new document generation with no existing file, skip to PHASE 1.

**Step 0.1 -- Extract normative context from document:**
- Read the file and identify: jurisdictions covered, normative sources cited (GDPR articles, EDPB guidelines, Garante provvedimenti, etc.), generation date or last-update date from metadata block
- Build a list of "normative dependencies" -- the specific regulations, guidelines, and rulings the document relies on
- If the document lacks a metadata block with date, ask the user when it was last generated/updated

**Step 0.2 -- Targeted regulatory search:**
- For each normative dependency, run WebSearch queries using year-based terms covering the years from document date to today (e.g. `guidelines 2025 2026`) as proxy for date filtering:
  - `site:edpb.europa.eu guidelines {topic} {year}` for new EDPB guidelines
  - `site:garanteprivacy.it provvedimenti {topic} {year}` for new Garante provvedimenti
  - `site:eur-lex.europa.eu {regulation} {year}` for legislative amendments
  - `site:curia.europa.eu {topic} {year}` for relevant new CJEU rulings
- Cap at 4-6 targeted queries, prioritizing jurisdictions and sources most central to the document. If many jurisdictions, focus on primary ones and note others as unchecked
- If WebSearch returns no results for a source, note it as "unable to verify" in the output. If all queries fail, report the delta check as inconclusive and proceed to PHASE 1

**Step 0.3 -- Cascading output:**

When updates are found, present a summary table:

```
## Regulatory Delta Check
Document: {filename}
Period: {document date} - {today}
Jurisdictions: {list}

| # | Source | Date | Update | Impacted section | Relevance |
|---|--------|------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | High/Medium/Low |

Want to drill into any items? Indicate the numbers.
```

When no updates are found:

```
## Regulatory Delta Check
Document: {filename}
Period: {document date} - {today}

No relevant normative updates detected for the jurisdictions and topics covered by this document.
```

Output language follows the existing convention (match user's language).

On user request for detail: explain the impact of the selected item and propose the specific modification to the document.

**Feeding into PHASE 1:** If updates are found, incorporate them into the context gathering questionnaire (e.g. "your document does not cover X, introduced by Y -- do you want to include it?").

---

# PHASE 1: CONTEXT GATHERING

## Step 1 -- Jurisdiction Setup

- Default: EU/Italy (GDPR + ePrivacy + Codice Privacy art. 122 + Garante guidelines)
- Ask user for target jurisdictions; mark unselected extras as "NON SPECIFICATO"
- If user selects USA/CA: activate CCPA/CPRA module
- If user selects Brazil: activate LGPD module
- If user selects Switzerland: activate FADP module

## Step 2 -- Business Profile

Collect:
- Business type, sector (e-commerce, healthcare/telemedicine, hospitality, digital services, SaaS, other)
- Website URL and/or app identifiers
- Data controller identity and contact (+ DPO if appointed)
- Countries of operation and user base

## Step 3 -- Processing Activities Questionnaire

**Base questions:**
- What personal data categories are collected? (identity, contact, financial, behavioral, location, device)
- What are the processing purposes? (service delivery, marketing, analytics, legal obligation, other)
- What is the legal basis per purpose? (consent, contract, legitimate interest, legal obligation)
- Who are the data subjects? (customers, employees, website visitors, minors)
- Who receives the data? (internal teams, processors, third parties, public authorities)

**Advanced questions (trigger-based):**
- Retention periods per data category
- International transfers -- destination countries, transfer mechanisms (SCC, adequacy, DPF)
- Special category data (health, biometric, genetic, political, religious) -- triggers Art. 9 + DPIA
- Minors' data -- triggers Art. 8 + age verification requirements
- Automated decision-making / profiling -- triggers Art. 22 disclosure

## Step 4 -- Cookie/Tracker Assessment

- List cookies and tracking technologies in use (analytics, marketing, functional, essential)
- For each non-essential tracker: require consent mechanism + pre-consent blocking
- Check: banner with reject option, easy withdrawal, no pre-ticked checkboxes (Planet49 CJEU)
- Verify alignment with Garante cookie guidelines (2021) and EDPB consent guidelines (05/2020)

---

# PHASE 2: RISK ANALYSIS & TRIGGERS

## DPIA Trigger Check

Evaluate against Art. 35 GDPR criteria + Garante's DPIA-required list:
- Large-scale processing of special categories
- Systematic monitoring of public areas
- Innovative technologies + vulnerable data subjects
- Scoring/profiling with legal effects
- Cross-dataset combination at scale

If triggered: generate "DPIA REQUIRED" warning + semi-guided DPIA outline (scope, necessity, risks, mitigations)

## Transfer Risk Assessment

If data leaves EEA:
- Identify transfer mechanism (SCC 2021/914, adequacy decision, BCRs)
- If USA + certified provider: note DPF (Decision 2023/1795) with limitations
- If non-adequate country + SCC: generate supplementary measures checklist (EDPB 01/2020)
- Flag "NON SPECIFICATO" for unverified provider certifications

## Sector Overlays

Activate additional requirements when sector detected:
- **Healthcare/telemedicine:** Art. 9 special categories, Italian telemedicine guidelines, enhanced security
- **Hospitality:** TULPS art. 109 obligations, public safety data flows
- **E-commerce:** D.Lgs. 70/2003 information requirements
- **Digital content:** Directive 2019/770 requirements

# LEGAL RESEARCH METHOD

Every document generation MUST include a research phase. Never rely solely on training data for normative claims -- verify against current sources.

## Source Authority Hierarchy

Ranked by reliability -- always prefer higher-tier sources:

1. **Official legal texts** -- EUR-Lex, Normattiva, Gazzetta Ufficiale, Fedlex
2. **DPA guidance** -- garanteprivacy.it, edpb.europa.eu, cnil.fr
3. **Court decisions** -- curia.europa.eu (CJEU), national courts
4. **Institutional commentary** -- European Commission, national ministries
5. **Specialist legal analysis** -- law firms, academic journals (verify credentials)
6. **DEPRIORITIZE** -- SEO blogs, AI-generated summaries, generic compliance sites

## Search Strategy

### Query Construction

Build queries that target official sources:

**For EU legislation:**
- `site:eur-lex.europa.eu "2016/679" article {N}` -- GDPR articles
- `site:eur-lex.europa.eu "2002/58" article 5` -- ePrivacy
- `site:eur-lex.europa.eu "2021/914"` -- SCC decision

**For national legislation (by jurisdiction):**
- Italy: `site:normattiva.it "196/2003" articolo {N}` -- Codice Privacy
- Italy: `site:gazzettaufficiale.it {decreto/legge reference}`
- Germany: `site:gesetze-im-internet.de {BDSG/TTDSG reference}`
- France: `site:legifrance.gouv.fr "loi informatique" OR "CNIL"`
- Spain: `site:boe.es "proteccion de datos" OR "LOPDGDD"`
- USA/California: `site:leginfo.legislature.ca.gov "1798" {section}`
- Brazil: `site:planalto.gov.br "LGPD" OR "13709"`
- Switzerland: `site:fedlex.admin.ch "235.1" OR "DSG"`
- UK: `site:legislation.gov.uk "data protection act 2018" OR "UK GDPR"`

**For DPA guidelines (by authority):**
- EU: `site:edpb.europa.eu guidelines {topic} {year}`
- Italy: `site:garanteprivacy.it {docweb number}` -- Garante provvedimenti
- Italy: `site:garanteprivacy.it "linee guida" {topic}`
- France: `site:cnil.fr {topic} guidelines`
- Germany: `site:datenschutzkonferenz-online.de {topic}`
- UK: `site:ico.org.uk guidance {topic}`
- Spain: `site:aepd.es guia {topic}`
- Brazil: `site:gov.br/anpd {topic}`

**For case law:**
- CJEU: `site:curia.europa.eu "Planet49"` or `"C-673/17"` -- case numbers
- `ECLI:{case identifier}` -- European Case Law Identifier
- National courts: search by case number + court name + "data protection"

### Search Sequencing

**Phase 1 -- Verify normative basis (BEFORE drafting):**
- Run 3+ parallel WebSearch queries for the key regulations applicable to the user's scenario
- Confirm article numbers, amendment status, and effective dates
- Check for recent Garante/EDPB decisions that modify interpretation

**Phase 2 -- Sector and jurisdiction check:**
- If sector overlay active: search for sector-specific guidance and recent enforcement
- If extra-EU jurisdictions: search for current adequacy decisions, SCC updates
- If transfer mechanisms involved: verify DPF certification status, SCC version currency

**Phase 3 -- Triangulation for high-risk clauses:**
- For clauses involving consent, special categories, DPIA, or transfers: require minimum 2 independent official sources
- If sources conflict: flag the discrepancy, cite both, mark as `[REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]`
- For cookie/tracker clauses: cross-check ePrivacy text + Garante guidelines + CJEU jurisprudence

### WebFetch for Source Extraction

When WebSearch finds a relevant official source:
1. WebFetch the specific page -- request only the relevant section (article, recital, guideline paragraph)
2. Extract: exact text, article/paragraph number, publication date, amendment history
3. Store as evidence for the clause metadata

### Recency Validation

Before generating any document:
- Check if cited guidelines have been updated or superseded
- Search `site:edpb.europa.eu` and `site:garanteprivacy.it` for the current year to catch new guidance
- If a key source is older than 2 years: actively search for updates or confirmations
- Note the "last verified" date in the evidence pack

## Research Output

For each document, produce an internal research log (included in evidence pack):

```
## Research Log
- Queries executed: {count}
- Official sources verified: {list with URLs}
- High confidence: {clauses with 2+ official sources}
- Medium confidence: {clauses with 1 official source}
- Needs verification: {clauses relying on training data only}
- Source recency: {oldest source date} to {newest source date}
```
