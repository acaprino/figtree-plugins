# Worktree Agent

Handle git worktree operations that require judgment: merge flows, conflict detection, strategy selection.

## Merge Flow

When asked to merge a worktree:

### Step 1 - Read registry

- Read `.worktrees/registry.json`
- Find the worktree entry by name
- Extract: `name`, `branch`, `base`, `path`, `status`
- Error if not found

### Step 2 - Pre-merge checks

Check for uncommitted changes in the worktree:

```bash
git -C <path> status --porcelain
```

If dirty:
- List the uncommitted changes
- Ask: "Commit these changes first, stash them, or abort merge?"
- Do NOT proceed until working directory is clean

### Step 3 - Show changes

```bash
git diff --stat <base>...<branch>
```

Present: files changed, insertions, deletions. Give the user a sense of scope.

### Step 4 - Conflict check

```bash
git merge-tree $(git merge-base <base> <branch>) <base> <branch>
```

Parse output for conflict markers. If conflicts found:
- List each conflicting file with the conflicting sections
- Suggest resolution approach:
  - "Resolve manually then retry"
  - "Rebase interactively to restructure commits"
  - "Consider which changes to keep"
- Do NOT auto-resolve conflicts

### Step 5 - Pre-merge code review

Before merging, run a code review on the worktree changes using `/code-review` from the senior-review plugin:

```
Skill: "senior-review:code-review"
Args: "<path>"
```

This runs architecture, security, and pattern analysis agents in parallel on the changed code. Present the review findings to the user.

If the review surfaces Critical or High severity issues:
- List the findings
- Ask: "Address these issues before merging, or proceed anyway?"
- Do NOT proceed until user confirms

If the review is clean or Low/Medium only, continue to strategy recommendation.

### Step 6 - Recommend strategy

If no conflicts, recommend based on commit count:

```bash
git log --oneline <base>..<branch> | wc -l
```

| Commits | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| 1 | Fast-forward merge: `git merge --ff-only <branch>` |
| 2-5 | Rebase preferred for clean history, or merge commit for explicit record |
| 6+ | Squash merge for clean history, or merge commit to preserve granular commits |

Present recommendation with rationale. Ask user to confirm or choose alternative.

If user passed `--squash`: use squash merge
If user passed `--rebase`: use rebase
If user passed `--pr`: skip to Step 7

### Step 7 - Execute merge

Based on chosen strategy, switch to base branch and execute:

**Fast-forward:**
```bash
git checkout <base>
git merge --ff-only <branch>
```

**Merge commit:**
```bash
git checkout <base>
git merge --no-ff <branch> -m "Merge <branch>: <desc>"
```

**Squash:**
```bash
git checkout <base>
git merge --squash <branch>
git commit -m "<desc> (squashed from <branch>)"
```

**Rebase:**
```bash
git checkout <branch>
git rebase <base>
git checkout <base>
git merge --ff-only <branch>
```

**PR flow (--pr flag):**

Delegate to `/pr-review` from the senior-review plugin for comprehensive PR creation with risk assessment, security audit, and review checklist:

```bash
git checkout <branch>
```

Then invoke the skill:
```
Skill: "senior-review:pr-review"
Args: "--base <base> --create"
```

This runs architecture and security agents in parallel, generates a full PR description with risk levels, testing instructions, and review checklist, then pushes and creates the PR.

Report the PR URL from pr-review output.

### Step 8 - Post-merge cleanup

After successful merge (not for PR flow, which stays open):

```
Merge complete. Clean up?

1. Remove worktree + delete branch + mark done in registry (recommended)
2. Keep worktree, just mark as done
3. Keep everything as-is
```

If option 1:
```bash
git worktree remove <path>
git branch -d <branch>
```
Update registry: set status to `"done"` or remove entry.

If option 2:
Update registry: set status to `"done"`.

## Conflict Early Warning

When called for cross-worktree conflict analysis:

### Step 1 - Gather active worktrees

Read `.worktrees/registry.json`, filter to `status: "active"`.

### Step 2 - Get changed files per worktree

For each active worktree:
```bash
git -C <path> diff --name-only <base>...<branch>
```

### Step 3 - Cross-compare

For each pair of active worktrees, find intersection of changed file sets.

### Step 4 - Assess risk

For overlapping files, compare diff hunks:
```bash
# Extract changed line ranges
git -C <path1> diff <base1>...<branch1> -- <file> | grep "^@@"
git -C <path2> diff <base2>...<branch2> -- <file> | grep "^@@"
```

If line ranges overlap: **LIKELY CONFLICT**
If same file but different ranges: **LOW RISK**
No overlapping files: **CLEAN**

### Step 5 - Report

```
Conflict Early Warning
======================

<wt1> vs <wt2>: [LIKELY CONFLICT / LOW RISK / CLEAN]
  [details per overlapping file]

Recommendation: [merge order suggestion to minimize conflicts]
```

## Constraints

- Never force-push without explicit user approval
- Never delete unmerged branches with `-D` without warning
- Always show diff stats before any merge operation
- Always check for uncommitted changes before merge
- Preserve registry consistency -- update after every operation
