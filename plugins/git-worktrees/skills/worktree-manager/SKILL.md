# Worktree Manager

Orchestrate parallel development through git worktrees. Proactively detect WIP state and offer isolation. Provide dashboards, context recovery, and conflict warnings.

## Proactive Trigger

Activate when session starts and working directory has WIP state. Detection:

```bash
# Uncommitted or staged changes
git status --porcelain

# Stashes
git stash list

# Unpushed commits (may fail if no upstream - that's ok)
git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

If ANY of these return output, present:

```
I notice you have work in progress:
  [X modified files / Y staged files / Z stashes / N unpushed commits]

Would you like to:
  A) Move this WIP into a worktree (stash, create worktree, apply there)
  B) Continue on current branch (I'll back off)
  C) Show details first
```

### Option A - Move WIP to worktree

1. Ask for worktree name and description
2. `git stash push -m "wt-migration: <name>"`
3. Create worktree via `/wt new <name>` flow
4. In the new worktree: `git stash pop`
5. Confirm: "WIP moved to worktree '<name>'. Current branch is now clean."

### Option B - Continue on current branch

Back off for the session. Do not prompt again about WIP state.

### Option C - Show details

Show full output of all three detection commands, then re-offer A/B.

## Dashboard

When asked "show my worktrees", "what am I working on", or "worktree status":

1. Read `.worktrees/registry.json`
2. For each worktree, gather:
   - `git -C <path> log --oneline <base>..<branch>` - commits ahead
   - `git -C <path> log --oneline <branch>..<base>` - commits behind base
   - `git -C <path> status --porcelain` - uncommitted changes
   - `git -C <path> log -1 --format=%ar` - last activity
3. Present:

```
Parallel Development Dashboard
==============================

[1] auth-refactor [active] - 2h ago
    Branch: wt/auth-refactor (from master)
    +5 commits, 0 behind | 3 modified files
    "Refactoring auth middleware for compliance"

[2] fix-login [paused] - 1d ago
    Branch: wt/fix-login (from master)
    +2 commits, 3 behind | clean
    "Fix OAuth login redirect bug"

Warnings:
  - fix-login is 3 commits behind master - consider rebasing
```

## Context Recovery

When user says "what am I working on" or returns after a break:

1. Show dashboard (above)
2. For the most recently active worktree, show:
   - Last 3 commit messages
   - Files currently modified
   - Any TODO/FIXME comments added in the branch diff
3. Suggest: "Want to continue with '<name>'? cd <path>"

## Multi-Worktree Creation

When user says "I need to work on N things" or lists multiple tasks:

1. Parse the tasks from user input
2. For each task, propose a worktree name and branch
3. Show plan:
   ```
   I'll create 3 worktrees:
     1. auth-refactor  -> wt/auth-refactor  "Refactor auth middleware"
     2. fix-login      -> wt/fix-login      "Fix OAuth redirect bug"
     3. add-dashboard  -> wt/add-dashboard  "New analytics dashboard"

   Proceed?
   ```
4. On confirmation, create all worktrees sequentially via `/wt new` flow
5. Show final dashboard

## Cleanup Advisor

When asked "clean up worktrees" or detected during dashboard:

Identify candidates:
- **Done**: worktrees where branch is fully merged into base
- **Stale**: worktrees with no commits in >7 days and status "active"
- **Missing**: registry entries where path no longer exists

Present:

```
Cleanup recommendations:

  Done (branch merged):
    - fix-login: branch wt/fix-login merged into master
      -> /wt rm fix-login

  Stale (no activity >7 days):
    - old-experiment: last commit 12 days ago
      -> Pause? Remove?

  Missing (path gone):
    - deleted-wt: path ../worktrees/project-deleted-wt not found
      -> Remove from registry
```

## Conflict Early Warning

When asked "check for conflicts" or proactively during dashboard if >1 active worktree:

1. For each pair of active worktrees, check file overlap:
   ```bash
   # Files changed in each worktree vs its base
   git -C <path1> diff --name-only <base1>...<branch1>
   git -C <path2> diff --name-only <base2>...<branch2>
   ```
2. Find intersection of changed files
3. For overlapping files, check if changes touch the same lines:
   ```bash
   git -C <path1> diff <base1>...<branch1> -- <file>
   git -C <path2> diff <base2>...<branch2> -- <file>
   ```
4. Report:

```
Conflict Risk Assessment
========================

auth-refactor vs fix-login:
  Overlapping files: 2
    src/middleware/auth.ts - LIKELY CONFLICT (both modify lines 45-80)
    src/config.ts - low risk (different sections)

auth-refactor vs add-dashboard:
  No overlapping files - clean

Recommendation: Merge auth-refactor first, then rebase fix-login.
```

## Commands Reference

Direct the user to `/wt` command for operations:
- `/wt new <name>` - create worktree
- `/wt list` - compact listing
- `/wt status` - detailed dashboard
- `/wt pause <name>` / `/wt resume <name>` - toggle status
- `/wt rm <name>` - remove worktree
- `/wt merge <name>` - guided merge flow
