  Standalone cross-platform security, architecture, and performance review -- audits code against the platform-engineering rulebook (server validation, auth token storage, WebAuthn/passkeys, API security, XSS/CSP, secrets, architecture patterns, bundle/perf) for SPA, PWA, mobile (iOS/Android), Electron, and Tauri.
  TRIGGER WHEN: the user asks for a platform-level review, cross-platform security audit, Electron/Tauri hardening check, or "review this for SPA/PWA/mobile/desktop compliance".
  DO NOT TRIGGER WHEN: reviewing generic code quality without platform-specific concerns (use /senior-review:code-review), UI design only (use /frontend:review-design), or pure backend API code without a client-side dimension.

# Platform Engineering Review

Standalone invocation of the `platform-reviewer` agent. Previously only reachable via `/senior-review:code-review` (Agent D) or the deprecated `/senior-review:full-review`. This command surfaces it directly for targeted cross-platform audits.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Detect platform first**. Scan `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `manifest.json`, `tauri.conf.json`, build configs to identify the platform mix. If `--platform auto` is set (default), report the detected platforms before reviewing.
2. **Run in parallel when multiple platforms are present**. A single repo may ship SPA + mobile + Tauri; load all applicable rulebooks.
3. **Write output to `.platform-review/REPORT.md`** for persistence.
4. **Never auto-fix**. Report findings; user decides what to apply.

## Procedure

### 1. Scope detection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- target path (default: current directory)
- `--platform`: force a specific platform or let auto-detect handle it
- `--focus`: restrict to `security` | `arch` | `perf` (default: all three)

Detect platforms:
- SPA: React/Vue/Svelte + no service worker
- PWA: `manifest.webmanifest` + service worker registered
- Mobile: Expo / React Native, Capacitor, NativeScript, Flutter
- Electron: `electron` in `package.json`
- Tauri: `@tauri-apps/api` + `src-tauri/`

### 2. Spawn the agent

Invoke `platform-engineering:platform-reviewer` with the target, detected platforms, and focus flag. The agent loads the relevant references from `skills/platform-engineering/references/`:

- Security: `server-validation.md`, `auth-tokens.md`, `passkeys-webauthn.md`, `api-security.md`, `xss-csp.md`, `secrets-management.md`, `platform-security.md`
- Architecture: `client-server-architecture.md`, `api-design.md`, `offline-first.md`, `infrastructure.md`
- Performance: `frontend-performance.md`, `backend-and-platform-performance.md`

For Electron / Tauri specifically, the agent also loads platform-security.md for the hardening checklist (fuses, asar integrity, capabilities, allowlists).

### 3. Output report

`.platform-review/REPORT.md`:

```markdown
# Platform Review -- <target> -- <date>

## Detected platforms
- SPA | PWA | Mobile | Electron | Tauri

## Summary
- Critical issues: N
- High: N
- Medium: N

## Findings

### [CRITICAL]
- <file:line> <issue> -- <rule violated> -- <fix>

### [HIGH]
- ...

### [MEDIUM]
- ...

## Hardening checklist (Electron / Tauri if applicable)
- [ ] fuses.yml configured with hardened defaults
- [ ] asar-integrity enabled for signed releases
- [ ] Capabilities scoped per window (Tauri)
- [ ] CSP includes 'strict-dynamic' + nonces
- [ ] Auto-updater signature verification

## Auth posture
- [ ] No JWT in localStorage (SPA/PWA)
- [ ] Refresh tokens in httpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict cookies
- [ ] PKCE for OAuth on SPA/Mobile/Desktop
- [ ] Platform-native secure storage for mobile/desktop tokens
- [ ] WebAuthn / passkeys implemented for new auth flows (recommended for 2025+)

## Synergies

- Deeper per-dimension code review -> `/senior-review:code-review`
- Tauri-specific hardening -> `tauri-development:tauri-desktop` agent
- React performance inside a platform context -> `/react-development:review-react`
- Security-specific audit only -> `senior-review:security-auditor` agent
